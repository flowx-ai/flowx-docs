Access authorizations in Integration Designer are provided with specified access scopes for both system and workflow management:

1. **Manage-systems** - for configuring access to integration systems.

   **Available scopes:**

   * **import** - allows users to import integration systems.
   * **read** - allows users to view integration systems.
   * **edit** - allows users to edit integration systems.
   * **admin** - allows users to administer integration systems.

<Info>
The workflow_read role allows users to view and monitor integration workflows without making changes:

* Can view all existing workflows and their details (canvas and sidebar).
* Can access the log console, warnings, and audit logs for audit and troubleshooting.
* Cannot create, update, or delete workflows.
* Cannot run workflows or nodes individually.
</Info>

2. **Manage-workflows** - for configuring access to integration workflows.

   **Available scopes:**

   * **import** - allows users to import integration workflows.
   * **read_restricted** - allows users to view restricted integration workflows.
   * **read** - allows users to view all integration workflows.
   * **edit** - allows users to edit integration workflows.
   * **admin** - allows users to administer integration workflows.

<Info>
The workflow_read-restricted role provides view-only access to integration workflows with limited permissions:

* Can view all workflows and their details (canvas and sidebar).
* Cannot access the log console, audit logs, or warnings.
* Cannot create, update, or delete workflows.
* Cannot run workflows or nodes individually (cannot see running instances).
* Can see instances and nodes, but logs, input, and output will show “unauthorized.”

> **Warning:** These roles must be defined in the selected identity provider, such as Keycloak, Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO), or another compatible identity provider.

### Customizing Access Roles

In cases where additional custom roles are required, you can configure them using environment variables. Multiple roles can be assigned to each access scope as needed.

**Environment Variable Format:**

To configure access for each role, use the following format:

**`SECURITY_ACCESSAUTHORIZATIONS_AUTHORIZATIONNAME_SCOPES_SCOPENAME_ROLESALLOWED: NEEDED_ROLE_NAMES`**

* **Possible values for `AUTHORIZATIONNAME`:** `MANAGE_SYSTEMS`, `MANAGE_WORKFLOWS`.
* **Possible values for `SCOPENAME`:** `import`, `read`, `read_restricted`, `edit`, `admin`.

For example, to configure a custom role with read access to manage systems, use:

```plaintext
SECURITY_ACCESSAUTHORIZATIONS_MANAGE_SYSTEMS_SCOPES_READ_ROLESALLOWED: ROLE_CUSTOM_SYSTEM_READ
```
