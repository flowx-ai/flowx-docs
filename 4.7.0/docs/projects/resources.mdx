## Overview

Resources are categorized into **Global Resources** and **Project Resources**. Each type of resource has unique characteristics that determine its usage, dependencies, and how it’s promoted between environments. Understanding these differences is crucial for efficient application development, management, and deployment.

---

## Global resources

Global Resources are elements designed to be **reused across multiple projects** or business contexts. These resources are often organized within **libraries**, enabling consistency and efficiency by providing a central repository of shared components.

### Key characteristics of global resources

- **Reusability**: Global Resources are created with the intention of reuse. They include common design elements, themes, fonts, and other assets that can be referenced by multiple projects.
- **Dependency Rules**: Libraries, which store Global Resources, **cannot have dependencies** on other libraries or projects. This ensures that Global Resources remain standalone, maximizing their adaptability across various business cases.
- **Project Independence**: These resources are not project-specific, making them versatile for broad use cases. Projects can reference libraries without requiring modifications to the core resources.
  
### Examples of global resources

1. **Design Assets**
   - **Themes**: Standardized themes provide a consistent look and feel across projects.
   - **System Assets**: Common media elements stored in the media library (e.g., images, icons) for theme customization.
   - **Fonts**: Font families that can be reused to maintain branding across different projects.
2. **Plugins**
    - **Languages**: Language packs or configurations that support multilingual capabilities across projects.
    - **Notification and Document Templates**: Managed at the global level, although they may be versioned for future releases.
    - **Out of office**:  Configurations or settings that manage out-of-office statuses across the platform.
3. **General settings**
    - **Users**: User accounts and profiles that can be accessed across multiple projects.
    - **Roles**: Defined roles that determine user permissions and access levels.
    - **Groups**: User groupings that facilitate collective management and permissions.
    - **Audit Log**: Logs that track changes and activities within the platform for security and compliance purposes.
4. **Libraries**: Organized resource containers including **enumerations**, **substitution tags**, and **CMS components** for multi-project use.

### Promotion of global resources

- **Promotion Workflow**: Global Resources within libraries are promoted separately from projects. They are typically **imported into the Designer UI** in target environments as part of their own libraries.
- **Configuration Management**: When libraries are promoted, existing configurations, such as **generic parameters**, are replaced by project-level configurations in the target environment.

---

## Project

Project Resources are resources specific to a particular **business use case**. Unlike Global Resources, these resources are confined to the context of the project they belong to, allowing for tailored configurations and dependencies on one or more libraries.

### Key characteristics of project

- **Business Specificity**: Project resources are tailored to a specific project, addressing unique business requirements.
- **Dependencies on Libraries**: Projects can reference libraries to access Global Resources, allowing for customization and adaptability.
- **Configurability**: Project-specific configurations are defined at the development stage, and values can be updated as needed in upper environments through environment variables or direct parameter overrides.

### Examples of project resources

1. **Processes**: Defined BPMN workflows specific to the project's business logic.
2. **CMS Components**: Custom CMS enumerations, substitution tags, and media items unique to the project.
3. **Task Management**:
    - **Views**: Configurable interfaces to display task-related data based on process definitions.
    - **Hooks**: Users with task management permissions can create hooks to trigger specific process instances, such as sending notifications when events occur.
    - **Stages**: Stages that allow task progression through different statuses.
    - **Allocation rules**: Define how tasks are assigned to users or teams.
4. **Integration Designer**:
    - **Systems**: A system is a collection of resources—endpoints, authentication, and variables—used to define and run integration workflows.
    - **Workflows**: A workflow defines a series of tasks and processes to automate system integrations. Within the Integration Designer, workflows can be configured using different components to ensure efficient data exchange and process orchestration.
6. **Configuration Parameters**: Project-specific rendering settings like `applicationUuid`, `locale`, `language`, and `process parameters`.
7. **Project Builds**: Builds represent finalized versions of the project, including all associated metadata and linked library versions.
8. **Project Settings**: Configure various aspects of a project like platform type, default theme, formatting, etc.

### Promotion of project resources

- **Promotion Workflow**: Only **builds** (not commits) are eligible for promotion to upper environments. Builds are exported from the development environment and imported into target environments via the Designer UI.
- **Design Asset Handling**: During import, any referenced design assets are created if absent but are not updated, ensuring consistency in upper environments.
- **Configuration Parameters Overrides**: Upper environment values replace development defaults, and these can be managed through environment variables, enabling flexibility without direct development environment access.

# Resources usage

Track and monitor where resources are used across processes, enumerations, and media assets to ensure smooth project management.


The **Resource Usage Tracking** feature provides real-time visibility into where and how resources are being used, preventing unintended changes and ensuring system stability.  

Key characteristics

- **View dependencies before making updates or deletions**  
- **Understand how resources interact across projectss**  
- **Ensure smooth transitions when modifying critical elements**  

Each resource type now includes a **Usage Overview modal**, which dynamically updates whenever references change. Users can quickly see where a resource is being used before making modifications.  

## Process usage

### View process usage  

1. **Accessing Usage Overview**  
   - In the **Process List**, an **icon** on each row opens the Usage Overview modal.  
   - Hovering over the icon displays a tooltip: *“Usage Overview”*.  

2. **Usage Modal Details**  
   - **Title**: `"<Process Name>" Process Usage Overview`  
   - Displays grouped references by resource type:
     - **Resource Type**: Process, UI Template, Workflow, etc.
     - **Reference Type**: Start Embedded Subprocess, Task Type, etc.
     - **Element**: Where the reference appears.
     - **Context**: Additional details such as node configurations.

   **Example Table:**
   
   | **Resource** | **Reference Type**                  | **Element**                                    | **Context**                                                     |

# Managing dependencies & tracking changes

- **Dynamic Updates**:  
  - Reference lists update automatically as resources are added or removed.  
  - When a **new resource version** is created, existing references are cloned into the new version.

- **Dependency Check Before Deletion**:  
  - Users receive a **confirmation hint** before deleting a resource, showing its references.  

- **Flip Side: Resources Referencing Other Resources**  
  - The **Usage Overview** modal also displays references **inside** a process, showing which resources it uses.



## How to access Resource usage tracking

### For any resource

1. **Go to the relevant resource list** (Processes, Enumerations, Media Library).
2. **Click the "Usage Overview" icon** next to the resource.
3. **View the modal** to see all references and dependencies.
4. **Take action accordingly** (update, modify, or delete).

### Before deleting a resource

- A confirmation modal appears if the resource has references.
- Users must confirm deletion after reviewing the references.

# Copy & duplicate resources 

Managing resources across projects is now **faster and more efficient**. The **Copy to Another Project** feature ensures all dependencies stay intact, while the **Duplicate Resource** functionality allows users to quickly reuse existing resources within the same project or library version.  

<Tabs>  
<Tab title="Copy to Another Project">  

1️⃣ **Select a destination** – Choose the target project or library.  
2️⃣ **Pick a branch (if applicable)** – For WIP versions, select the target branch.  
3️⃣ **Review dependencies** – The system displays referenced resources and validates dependencies.  
4️⃣ **Resolve identifier conflicts** – If an identifier already exists in the destination, you'll be prompted to either:  
   - **Keep both** (create a duplicate)  
   - **Replace** (overwrite the existing resource)  
   - **Use destination** (retain the existing resource without copying)  

💡 **Handling conflicts:** The system automatically detects duplicate identifiers and provides a clear choice to avoid unintended overwrites.  

</Tab>  

<Tab title="Duplicate Resources">  

The **Duplicate Resource** feature lets users create a copy of an existing resource within the same project or library version, streamlining workflows and ensuring quick reusability.  

**You can duplicate:**  
- **Processes**  
- **Enumerations**  
- **Media files (including Global media library files)**  
- **Notification templates**  
- **Document templates**  
- **Views**  

### 🔹 **How it works**  
- **Duplicate options** are available from each resource’s three-dot menu (table row & secondary navigation).  
- When selected, a **"Duplicate" modal** opens with a prefilled name: _Copy of [Resource Name]_ (which can be edited).  
- **Cancel** to discard changes or **Duplicate** to create an exact copy in the same project/library version.  
- **Success confirmation:** The system navigates to the newly created resource and displays a success message.  
- **Error handling:** If a resource with the same name/key exists, users will be prompted to rename it before proceeding.
