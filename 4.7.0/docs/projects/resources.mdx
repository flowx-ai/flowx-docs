description: Overview of Global and project resources, including their usage, dependencies, promotion, and configuration within the platform.

## Overview

Resources are categorized into **Global Resources** and **Project Resources**. Each type has unique characteristics that define its usage, dependencies, and promotion between environments. Understanding these distinctions ensures efficient project development, management, and deployment.

---

## Global resources

Global Resources are designed for **reuse across multiple projects** or business contexts.

<Info>
These resources are often organized within **libraries**, enabling consistency and efficiency by providing a central repository of shared components.
</Info>

### Key characteristics

- **Reusable**: Common design elements, themes, fonts, and other assets can be used in multiple projects.
- **Independent**: Global Resources exist outside individual projects, making them adaptable across different business cases.
- **No Dependencies**: These resources are not project-specific, making them versatile for broad use cases. Projects can reference libraries without requiring modifications to the core resources.

### Examples 

#### Design assets

- **Themes**: Standardized themes for consistent styling.
- **Global Media Library**: Shared images, icons, and other assets.
- **Fonts**: Reusable font families to maintain branding.

#### Plugins

- **Languages**: Language packs or configurations that support multilingual capabilities across projects.
- **Templates**: Notification and document templates managed at a global level.
- **Out-of-Office Settings**: Platform-wide absence management settings.

#### General settings

- **Users**: User accounts and profiles that can be accessed across multiple projects.
- **Roles**: Defined roles that determine user permissions and access levels.
- **Groups**: User groupings that facilitate collective management and permissions.
- **Audit Log**: Logs that track changes and activities within the platform for security and compliance purposes.

#### Libraries

Organized resource containers including **enumerations**, **substitution tags**, and **CMS components** for multi-project use.

### Promotion workflow

- **Library Promotion**: Global Resources within libraries are promoted separately from projects. They are typically **imported into the Designer UI** in target environments as part of their own libraries.
- **Configuration Management**: When libraries are promoted, existing configurations, such as **generic parameters**, are replaced by project-level configurations in the target environment.

---

## Project resources

Project Resources are specific to a **business use case**. Unlike Global Resources, they belong to a single project, allowing for custom configurations and dependencies on libraries.


### Key characteristics

- **Project-Specific**: Tailored to a single project’s needs.
- **Library Dependencies**: Can reference and extend Global Resources.
- **Configurable**: Parameters can be updated in upper environments through environment variables or overrides.

### Examples

1. **Processes**: BPMN workflows customized for the project’s business logic.
2. **CMS Components**: Project-specific enumerations, substitution tags, and media items.
3. **Task Management**:
    - **Views**: Configurable interfaces to display task-related data based on process definitions.
    - **Hooks**: Users with task management permissions can create hooks to trigger specific process instances, such as sending notifications when events occur.
    - **Stages**: Stages that allow task progression through different statuses.
    - **Allocation rules**: Define how tasks are assigned to users or teams.
4. **Integration Designer**:
    - **Systems**: A system is a collection of resources—endpoints, authentication, and variables—used to define and run integration workflows.
    - **Workflows**: A workflow defines a series of tasks and processes to automate system integrations. Within the Integration Designer, workflows can be configured using different components to ensure efficient data exchange and process orchestration.
6. **Configuration Parameters**: Project-specific rendering settings like `applicationUuid`, `locale`, `language`, and `process parameters`.
7. **Project Builds**: Builds represent finalized versions of the project, including all associated metadata and linked library versions.
8. **Project Settings**: Configure various aspects of a project like platform type, default theme, formatting, etc.

### Promotion workflow

- **Build-Based Promotion**: Only **builds** (not commits) are promoted.
- **Design Asset Handling**: Referenced assets are created if missing but are not updated during import.
- **Configuration Parameters Overrides**: Environment variables replace default values in upper environments.

## Resources usage tracking

Track where resources are used to prevent unintended changes and ensure stability.

</Frame>

The **Resource Usage Tracking** feature provides real-time visibility into where and how resources are being used, preventing unintended changes and ensuring system stability.  

**Key features**

- **View Dependencies** before making updates or deletions.
- **Understand Resource Interactions** across projects.
- **Prevent Issues** when modifying critical elements.

Each resource type includes a **Usage Overview modal**, which updates dynamically as references change.

### Process usage


1. **Access Usage Overview**
   - Click the **Usage Overview icon** in the **Process List**.
2. **Usage Modal Details**
   - Displays references by resource type (e.g., Process, UI Template, Workflow).
   - Provides detailed context, including node configurations.

#### Deleting a process with references 

- A **confirmation modal** warns users before deletion.
- The modal lists all affected references.

### Enumeration usage

1. **Access Usage Overview**
   - Click the **Usage Overview icon** in the **Enumeration List**.
2. **Usage Modal Details**
   - Shows where the enumeration is referenced (e.g., UI Designer, Data Model, Workflow)

### Media library usage 

1. **Access Usage Overview**
   - Click the **Usage Overview icon** in the **Media Library List**.
2. **Usage Modal Details**
   - Displays where media files are used (e.g., UI Template, Process).

---

### Managing dependencies & tracking changes

- **Dynamic Updates**: Reference lists update automatically as resources change.
- **Dependency Checks**: Users see affected resources before deletion.
- **Bidirectional Tracking**: The **Usage Overview modal** also shows resources referenced **inside** a process.

## Copying resources

Use the **Copy to Another Project** feature to transfer resources while maintaining dependencies.

If an identifier already exists in the destination, you'll be prompted to either:  

   - **Keep Both**: Create a duplicate.
   - **Replace**: Overwrite existing resource.
   - **Use Destination**: Keep existing resource without copying.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Handling conflicts:** The system automatically detects duplicate identifiers and provides a clear choice to avoid unintended overwrites.
