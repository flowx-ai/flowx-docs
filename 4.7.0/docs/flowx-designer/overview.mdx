# Overview

Let's go through the main options available in the **FlowX Designer**:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title ="Projects" icon ="folder">

A project is a comprehensive workspace that groups all resources, dependencies, and configurations needed to implement a specific use case. It enables centralized resource management, version control, and build deployment across different environments, allowing teams to organize processes, integrations, media, and other assets in a modular and reusable manner.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title ="Libraries" icon ="book">

A library is a specialized project type designed to store and share reusable resources like processes, enumerations, and media assets across multiple projects. Libraries enable centralized resource management, version-controlled dependency management, and modular development by allowing projects to reference specific builds of shared resources.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title ="Processes" icon ="arrow-progress">

#### Process Definitions

* create, view, run and edit [processes](../building-blocks/process/process-definition)
* view versioning history

#### Active Process

* [token](../building-blocks/token) instance and its content
* [subprocesses](../building-blocks/process/subprocess)

</Accordion>

<Accordion title ="Content Management" icon ="folder-grid">

#### Enumerations

* nomenclature containing static value definitions
* used to manage a list of values that can be used as content in UI components or templates

#### Substitution tags

* used for multiple source systems, if multiple [**enumerations**](../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/content-management/enumerations) values are needed to communicate with other systems

[Example here](../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/content-management/content-management)

#### Media Library

* serves as a centralized hub for managing and organizing various types of media files, including images, GIFs, and more

#### Font files

#### Themes

* The Theme Management feature allows for the personalization of application appearance through easy management and customization of themes.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title ="Plugins" icon ="puzzle-piece-simple">

#### Task Management

* it is a **plugin** suitable for back-officers and supervisors as it can be used to easily track and assign activities/tasks inside a company
* for more information, check the [Task Management](../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/task-management/task-management-overview) section

#### Notification templates

* send various types of notifications: SMS, push notifications to mobile devices, emails
* forward custom notifications to external outgoing services
* generate and validate [OTP](../platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/notifications-plugin/otp-flow/) passwords for user identity verification
* for more information, check the [Notification templates plugin](../platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/notifications-plugin/notifications-plugin-overview) section

#### Document templates

* store and make changes to documents
* generate documents based on predefined templates (docx or HTML) and custom process related data
* convert documents between various formats
* splitting bulk documents into smaller separate documents
* editing documents to add generated barcodes/signatures and pictures
* for more information, check the [Document templates plugin](../platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/documents-plugin/documents-plugin-overview) section

</Accordion>

<Accordion title ="General Settings" icon ="gears">

#### Configuration parameters

* you can add configuration parameters by defining key-value pairs
* they are used for values that might change from one environment to another
* for example, an URL that has different values from a development environment to a production environment

#### Access management

* Access Management is used to administrate users, roles and groups
* Access Management is accessing keycloak through an API call, extracting all the necessary details
* it is based on user roles that need to be configured in the identity management solution

#### Integration management

* Integration management helps you configure integrations between the following components: [**FlowX Process engine**](../platform-deep-dive/core-components/flowx-engine), [**plugins**](../platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/), or different adapters
* Integration management enables you to keep track of each integration and its correspondent component and different scenarios used: creating an OTP, document generation, notifications, etc

</Accordion>

<Accordion title ="Platform status" icon ="signal-bars">

<summary>Platform status</summary>

* you can check the platform's health by using the **Platform Status** feature
* you can also check the installed versions against the suggested versions for each FlowX component

## Managing process definitions

A **process definition** is uniquely identified by its name and version number.

## Viewing active process instances

The complete list of active **process instances** is visible from the FLOWX Designer. They can be filtered by **process definition** names and searched by their unique ID. You can also view the current process instance status and data.

## Managing CMS

Using the content management feature you can perform multiple actions that enable manipulation of the content and simplification of it. You need first to deploy the CMS service in your infrastructure, so you can start defining and using the custom content types described in the **Content Management** tab above.

## Managing users access

Access Management is used to administrate users, roles and groups, directly in FLOWX Designer. Access Management helps you to access the identity management solution (keycloak/[RH-SSO](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on)) through its API, extracting all the necessary details. Access Management is based on user roles that need to be configured in the identity management solution.

## Managing integrations

Integration management enables you to keep track of each integration and its correspondent component and different scenarios used: creating an OTP, document generation, notifications, etc.

## Checking platform status

You can quickly check the health status of all the **FlowX services** and all of your custom connectors.
