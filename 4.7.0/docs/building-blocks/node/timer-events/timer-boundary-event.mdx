title: Timer boundary event
description: A Timer Boundary Event in Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a specialized event attached to a specific task or subprocess within a process. It activates when a predefined time condition—such as a duration, deadline, or specific date—is met while the associated task or subprocess is still in progress.
---

This event is used to integrate time-related triggers into workflows, allowing processes to respond automatically to time-sensitive requirements. It is particularly useful for enforcing deadlines, scheduling periodic actions, or sending notifications, ensuring that time-critical steps are seamlessly incorporated into the overall process design.ary Events are utilized to incorporate time-related conditions into processes, enabling actions to be taken at specified time intervals, deadlines, or specific dates. This capability is especially valuable for scenarios where time-sensitive actions or notifications need to be integrated seamlessly within process flows.


### Compatibility matrix for Timer Events

**Timer Events** can be applied to various contexts within BPMN processes. The table below outlines their compatibility with different node types:

| **Node Type**                 | **Timer Event - Interrupting** | **Timer Event - Non-Interrupting** |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **User Task**                 | Yes                            | Yes                                |
| **Service Task**              | Yes                            | Yes                                |
| **Send Message Task**         | Yes                            | Yes                                |
| **Receive Message Task**      | Yes                            | Yes                                |
| **Start Embedded Subprocess** | No                             | No                                 |
| **Call Activity**             | Yes                            | Yes                                |



## Timer boundary event - interrupting

A Timer Boundary Event is an event attached to a specific activity (task or subprocess) that is triggered when a specified time duration or date is reached. It can interrupt the ongoing activity and initiate a transition.

### Configuration

For Timer Boundary Events - Interrupting, the following values can be configured:

| Field      | Validations | Accepted Values                  |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| Definition | Mandatory   | ISO 8601 formats (date/duration) |
|            |             | Process param                    |

</Frame>

### General rules

* When the token enters the parent activity, a scheduler is set, and it waits for the timer event to be triggered.
* When the timer is triggered, the ongoing activity is terminated, and the process continues with the defined transition.

## Timer boundary event - non-interrupting

A Timer Boundary Event is an event attached to a specific activity (task or subprocess) that is triggered when a specified time duration or date is reached. It can trigger independently of the ongoing activity and initiate a parallel path.

### Configuration

For Timer Boundary Events - Non-Interrupting, the following values can be configured:

| Field      | Validations | Accepted Values                  |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| Definition | Mandatory   | ISO 8601 formats (date/duration) |
|            |             | Process param                    |

### General rules

* When a token arrives at a node with a Timer Boundary Event - Non-Interrupting associated:
    * A trigger is scheduled, but the current token execution remains unaffected.
* When the token enters the parent activity, a scheduler is set, and it waits for the timer event to be triggered.
* If the timer is a cycle, it is rescheduled for the specified number of repetitions.
* The scheduler is canceled if the token leaves the activity before it is triggered.
