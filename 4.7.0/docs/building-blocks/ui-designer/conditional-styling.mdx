title: Conditional styling
description: Dynamically update styling and properties of UI elements based on conditions, reducing the need for multiple prototypes.
---

Conditional styling enables dynamic, data-driven design adjustments based on specific conditions. It helps reduce the need for multiple prototypes by applying styles conditionally, depending on the data and platform-specific configurations.

<Info>
**Conflict Resolution:** When multiple conditions overlap, the latest condition (evaluated from top-to-bottom) takes priority.
</Info>

---

## Configuring conditional styling

1. Open the **UI Designer**.
2. Select a **Text**, **Link**, or **Container** element.
3. Navigate to the **Styles** tab.
4. Locate the **Conditional Styling** section.
5. Click the **âž•** icon to add new expressions and effects.
6. Use the **JS Editor** to configure and test your expressions for accurate behavior.

## Structure of conditional styling

1. **Condition:**
   - A string expression evaluated similarly to hide/disable expressions.
   - Supports referencing process data store keys for dynamic evaluations.

2. **Overrides:**
   - A key-value map defining specific property-value pairs.
   - Overrides are applied based on the evaluated condition.

### Example:

```json
{
  "platformDisplayOptions": {
    "platform": "web",
    "style": {
      "conditionals": [
        {
          "condition": "$user.age > 30",
          "overrides": {
            "backgroundColor": "#FFD700",
            "fontWeight": "bold"
          }
        },
        {
          "condition": "$user.subscription == 'premium'",
          "overrides": {
            "borderColor": "#4CAF50",
            "textColor": "#FFFFFF"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```


## Renderer behavior

* **Real-Time Evaluation**: Conditions are continuously evaluated based on live data updates.
* **Priority Handling**: If multiple conditions are met, the last condition in the sequence takes precedence.
* **Dynamic Application**: Styles are applied instantly upon condition satisfaction, enhancing UI responsiveness.

## Contextual menu options

* Conditional Styling Section: Copy To/From Platforms to reuse conditions across different environments.
* Expression + Effect Section: Copy To/From Platforms and Delete options for efficient management.
