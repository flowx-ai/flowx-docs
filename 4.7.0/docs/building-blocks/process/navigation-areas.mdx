title: Navigation Areas
description: Navigation areas play a pivotal role in user interface design. They enhance the user experience by providing a structured, organized, and efficient way for users to interact with and explore various features and solutions.
---

<Info>
In the navigation panel, the navigation hierarchy appears beneath platform tabs, which include options for both Web and Mobile platforms. The Web platform tab is selected by default when opening the panel.

## Adding New Areas

To create a new navigation area:

1. Open **FlowX Designer**
2. Either open an existing process definition or create a new one
3. Toggle the navigation areas menu by clicking on **Navigation View**
4. Select **Create New Area**

<Info>
Navigation configurations created on one platform (for example, Web) are not automatically duplicated to other platforms. You must manually copy or recreate them for each platform.

## Interacting with Areas

After adding a navigation area, you can interact with it through the breadcrumbs menu, which provides these options:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Area Settings">

<Frame>
<img src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/area_settings.gif" style={{ maxHeight: '500px' }}/>
</Frame>

Use **Area Settings** to configure:

* **Name** - The name for the navigation area element that appears in the **Navigation Menu**

<Info>
This name is not the label visible in the process at runtime. To set the visible label, use the UI Designer to edit the element.
To do this:
1. Trigger the **Navigation View** menu
2. Navigate to your element
3. Click on the breadcrumbs
4. Select "UI Designer"
</Info>

* **Alternative Flows** - Configure process nodes to be included or excluded based on start conditions


</Accordion>
<Accordion title="UI Designer">

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/ui_designer_navigation_areas.gif)
</Frame>

The UI Designer allows you to configure:

* **Settings**:
    * **Generic**: Cross-platform properties available for Web, Android, and iOS
    * **Platform-specific Configuration and Styling**: Customize components for each platform individually

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Copy/Paste">

<Frame>

</Frame>

The "Copy Navigation Areas" feature lets you replicate navigation hierarchies and elements between platforms.

<Warning>
This feature only works within the same process definition and environment. You cannot copy across different process definitions or environments.
</Warning>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Delete an Area">

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/delete_area.gif)
</Frame>

To delete a navigation area:

1. Access the **Navigation View** menu in FlowX Designer
2. Select the target navigation area
3. Click the breadcrumbs menu on the right
4. Choose **Delete Area**

<Info>
Deleting a navigation area removes all associated child areas. Any user tasks within the deleted area will be unassigned and moved to the User Tasks section in **Navigation View**.

### Stepper

A stepper breaks down complex processes into logical, numbered steps for intuitive navigation.

<Frame>

</Frame>

Steppers can track progress and allow users to return to previously visited steps.

#### Stepper in Step Example

#### Steps

Steps are individual elements within a stepper that help break down complex processes.

### Tab Bar

The Tab Bar facilitates navigation and content organization through a tabbed interface.

</Frame>

Key features:

<CardGroup>
<Card title="Parallel Zones">
Supports parallel zones within the same user task for seamless navigation between different sections.
</Card>
<Card title="Multiple Tabs">
Enables quick switching between various views or tasks through multiple accessible tabs.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Frame>

</Frame>

When implementing a tab bar zone in your BPMN diagram, always use **Parallel Gateway** nodes to define the zone. Use one Parallel Gateway to open the zone and another to close it.

<Warning>
**Mobile Development Note**: On mobile devices, always position the tab bar as a **root component** in navigation. It should remain consistently visible for optimal navigation.
