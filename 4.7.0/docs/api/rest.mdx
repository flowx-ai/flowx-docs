title: Process status
api: GET https://admin.devmain.flowxai.dev/api/process/{PROCESS_INSTANCE_ID}/status
---

Processes can be started by making an API call. Certain parameters needed by the process can be sent on the request body.

Some special cases for stating process instances are:

* starting a process instance from another instance and inhering some data from the first one to the second
* a process can have multiple start nodes, in which case, a start condition must be set when making the start process call
