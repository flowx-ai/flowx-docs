* set message content to be sent
  * `{"test" : ${processInstanceId}, "title": "Test title"}`

<Info>
The nodes that support actions are [task nodes](../../building-blocks/node/task-node), [user task nodes](../../building-blocks/node/user-task-node), and [send message/receive message tasks](../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node).
