# Creating a New Process Definition

Every business process in FlowX Designer starts with creating a [process definition](../../building-blocks/process/process-definition). Each process definition requires at least one [START](../../building-blocks/node/start-end-node#start-node) and one [END](../../building-blocks/node/start-end-node#end-node) node to function properly.

## Steps for Creating a New Process Definition

Follow these steps to create your first process definition:

<Steps>
<Step>
Launch the **FLOWX Designer** application and navigate to the **Definitions** tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Locate and click the **New process** button in the top-right corner of the screen using the **breadcrumbs** navigation.
</Step>
<Step>
In the creation dialog, input a unique name for your process definition and click **Create** to confirm.
</Step>
<Step>
The system will automatically redirect you to the **FLOWX Designer** editor interface where you can begin designing your process flow.
</Step>
</Steps>
