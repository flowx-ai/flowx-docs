### How to Create Conditional Branches Using Exclusive Gateways

Learn how to create a process flow with conditional branching using exclusive gateways. This guide will show you how to implement business decisions and route your workflow based on specific conditions.

### Step-by-Step Guide for Creating Conditional Branches

<Steps>
<Step>
Open **FlowX Designer** and navigate to the **Definitions** tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Create a new process by clicking the **New process** button in the top-right breadcrumbs.
</Step>
<Step>
Begin by adding a **start node** followed by an **exclusive gateway node** (also known as a decision node).
</Step>
<Step>
Create two different **task nodes** and connect them after the **exclusive gateway node** to create your conditional paths.
</Step>
<Step>
Add a second **exclusive gateway** to reunite the two flow branches back into a single path.
</Step>
<Step>
Configure the business decision by adding a **new rule** to the node. For example:

* Choose a **scripting language** from the available options
* Example conditions:
  * `input.get("application.client.creditScore") >= 700` → route to premium credit card flow
  * `input.get("application.client.creditScore") < 700` → route to standard credit card flow
</Step>
<Step>
Add a **closing exclusive gateway** to merge the paths and continue the process flow.
</Step>
<Step>
Complete the flow with an **end node**.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Configuring Decision Rules

For implementing [business rules](../../building-blocks/actions/business-rule-action/business-rule-action), you'll need to:
1. Define conditions based on process values
2. Specify which outgoing path to take when conditions are met
3. Ensure the gateway node is properly connected to subsequent nodes before setting up rules
