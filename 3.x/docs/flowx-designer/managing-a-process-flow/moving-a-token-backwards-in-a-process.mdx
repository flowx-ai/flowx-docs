title: Moving a token backwards in a process
description: Learn how to navigate backwards in a business process flow using token reset functionality. Understand how to redo previous steps, manage process data, and implement backwards navigation in your FLOWX.AI processes.

**Why is it useful?** The backwards navigation functionality brings a whole new level of flexibility in using a business flow or journey, allowing users to navigate back and redo steps without losing previously entered data.

In most cases, the **process token** instance will advance forward in the process as actions are completed sequentially.

However, there are scenarios where a token needs to move backward to redo or revisit previous actions in the process. This backward movement capability is essential for flexible process navigation and error correction.

We will call this behavior **resetting the token** or **backwards navigation**.

The token can only be reset to specific actions on designated process nodes. These actions are marked with a `allowTokenReset` flag. When such an action is triggered from the application:
- The current process token will be marked as aborted
- A new token will be created and placed on the node containing the executed action
- Any sub-processes started between the two token positions will be aborted during the reset

The newly created token inherits all information about actions performed before the reset point from the initial token.

To control data retention during token reset, you can use these configuration options:

* `restartFromSnapshot` - when set to true, process parameter values revert to their state before the first execution of that action
* `keysForRestart` - specify an array of process parameter keys to be preserved from the initial execution
