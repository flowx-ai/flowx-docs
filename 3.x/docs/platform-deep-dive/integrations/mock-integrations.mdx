## Setup

To begin, configure the microservice's DB settings to use a Postgres DB. Then, deploy the mocked adapter microservice.

## Adding a new integration

Setting up a mocked integration requires only one step: adding a mock Kafka request and response.

You have two options for accomplishing this:

1. Add the information directly to the DB.
2. Use the provided [**API**](/3.x/docs/api/add-kafka-mock).

For each Kafka message exchange between the engine and the integration, you need to create a separate entry.
