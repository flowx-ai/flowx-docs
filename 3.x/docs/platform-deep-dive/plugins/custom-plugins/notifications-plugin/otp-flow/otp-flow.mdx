The notifications plugin provides comprehensive support for handling One-Time Password (OTP) functionality. The OTP flow consists of two main steps: OTP generation and OTP validation.

### OTP Configuration

You can customize the OTP behavior by configuring the following environment variables:

* `FLOWX_OTP_LENGTH` - Define the number of characters in the generated OTP
* `FLOWX_OTP_EXPIRE_TIME_IN_SECONDS` - Set the time duration (in seconds) for which the OTP remains valid

These configurations allow you to implement secure and flexible OTP-based authentication flows.

Let's explore the detailed implementation of both steps:
