title: Using hooks
description: Hooks allow you to extract stateful logic from a component, so it can be tested and reused independently.

Users with task management permissions can create hooks to trigger specific **process instances**, such as sending notifications when **events** occur. Follow the instructions below to set up roles for hooks scope usage:

Hooks can be linked to different events and define what will happen when they are triggered. Below you can find a list of all possible triggers for each hook.

<Tab title="Process">
<ul>
<li>unique result</li>
<li>only one rule will match, or no rule</li>
</ul>
</Tab>

<Tab title ="Swimlane">
<ul>
<li>rule outputs are prioritized</li>
<li>rules may overlap, but only match with the highest output priority counts </li>
</ul>
</Tab>

<Tab title ="Stage">
<ul>
<li> unique results </li>
<li>multiple rules can be satisfied </li>
<li>all satisfied rules must generate the same output, otherwise the rule is violated</li>
</ul>
</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Types of hooks

There are three types of hooks you can create in Task Manager:

* process hooks
* swimlane hooks
* stage hooks

<Info>
Swimlane and stage hooks can be configured with an SLA (time when a triggered process is activated).
</Info>

<Info>
Dismiss SLA is available only for hooks configured with SLA.

[Here](../../../../building-blocks/node/timer-events/timer-expressions) you can find more information about the SLA - duration formatting.
