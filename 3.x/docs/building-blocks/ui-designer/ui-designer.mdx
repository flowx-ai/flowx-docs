title: Overview
description: The FLOWX.AI platform offers a variety of ready-to-use [UI components](./ui-designer#ui-component-types) that can be used to create rich web interfaces. These include common form elements like [input fields](./ui-component-types/form-elements/input-form-field), [dynamic dropdown menus](./ui-component-types/form-elements/select-form-field#example---dynamic-dropdowns), [checkboxes](./ui-component-types/form-elements/checkbox-form-field), [radio](./ui-component-types/form-elements/radio-form-field), and [switch buttons](./ui-component-types/form-elements/switch-form-field), as well as other UI elements like image, text, anchor links, etc. The properties of each component can be customized further using the details tab, and [design flexibility](./#styling) is achieved by adding styles or CSS classes to the pre-defined components. The UI templates are built in a hierarchical structure, with a root component at the top.

## Using UI designer

The FLOWX.AI platform includes an intuitive **UI Designer** for creating diverse UI templates. You can use various elements such as basic buttons, indicators, and forms, as well as predefined [collections](./ui-component-types/collection/collection) and [prototypes](./ui-component-types/collection/collection_prototype). To access the UI Designer, follow these steps:

1. Open **FLOWX.AI Designer** and select **Definitions** from the **Processes** tab.
2. Select a **process** from the process definitions list.
3. Click the **Edit** **process** button.
4. Select a **node** then click the **brush icon** in the Process Designer navigation menu to open the **UI Designer**.

<Info>
The UI designer is available for [**User task**](../node/user-task-node) nodes and [**Milestone**](../node/milestone-node) nodes (nodes that require human interaction).
</Info>

After adding a specific component to the node, the right-side menu will display more configuration options.

<Tip>
For more flexibility, undo or redo actions are available within the UI Designer. This includes tasks such as dragging, dropping, or deleting elements from the preview section, as well as adjusting settings within the styling and settings panel.

To undo or redo an action, users can simply click the corresponding icons in the UI Designer toolbar, or use the keyboard commands for even quicker access.
</Tip>

## UI components

FLOWX.AI offers a wide range of [UI components](./ui-designer#ui-components) that can be customized using the UI Designer. For example, when configuring a [card](./ui-component-types/root-components/card) element (which is a root component), the following properties can be customized:


#### Settings

* **Message** - a valid JSON string that is pushed to the frontend application when the process reaches [user task](../node/user-task-node); this property is only available for [Root components](./ui-component-types/root-components/root-components)
* **Properties** - custom properties that vary depending on the component type
* **Has Accordion** (available only for **Card** component) - a Bootstrap accordion is a component that organizes content within collapsible items, allowing only one collapsed item to be displayed at a time

## Styling

In FLOWX.AI, styling options are available for components that group children, which can be found under the styling section. 

Users can customize the direction, alignment, gap, sizing, and spacing of their layout. These properties help to create well-organized and visually pleasing user interfaces.

### Layout 

Layout configuration is available for components that group children: [root components](./ui-component-types/root-components/) and [forms](./ui-component-types/form-elements) (more details about layouts can be found [here](https://tburleson-layouts-demos.firebaseapp.com/#/docs)):

   * Direction - horizontal or vertical
   * Alignment - start, center, end, stretch
   * Wrap - content will wrap to the next line when it reaches the end of a line within the element
   * Gap - the gap property defines the size of the gap between the rows and between the columns

## UI component types

Different UI component types can be configured using UI Designer. The components can be configured only using user task nodes or milestone nodes.

<Info>
Depending on the [component type](./ui-designer#ui-component-types) different properties are available for configuration.
</Info>

Understanding these component types will help you to better utilize the UI Designer tool and create rich web interfaces efficiently.
