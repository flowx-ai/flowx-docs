## Properties and settings

### Settings

#### When used as root

When utilized as the root component, the card provides the following settings:

- **Message**: A valid JSON describing the data transmitted to the frontend when the process reaches a specific user task.
- **Title**: The title of the card.
- **Subtitle**: A subtitle accompanying the card.
- **Card style**: Choose between a border or raised style for the card.
- **Has accordion**: This feature introduces a Bootstrap accordion, facilitating the organization of content within collapsible items. It ensures that only one collapsed item is displayed at a time.

<Warning> 
Starting from platform version **3.4.7**, the "Message" property for cards has been replaced with "Custom UI Payload." In User Tasks containing UI Elements, the Backend (BE) automatically dispatches all relevant data as process variables to the Frontend (FE) by default. Explicitly mentioning data to be pushed is no longer required.

When the card is not the root, you can configure: **Title**, **Subtitle**, **Card Style** and **Has Accordion**.
