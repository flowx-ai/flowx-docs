title: Root Components - Layout Elements and Container Types
description: Root components (layout elements) are fundamental building blocks used to structure and organize UI elements. They include containers, custom components, and cards for grouping and arranging different types of components in your application interface.
---

* [**Container**](./container) - Used to group and configure the layout for multiple components of any type. Also known as a wrapper or layout container.
* [**Custom** ](./custom) - Angular components developed in the container application and passed to the SDK at runtime, identified here by the component name.
* [**Card**](./card) - Acts like a [**Container**](./container) component; it also has the option to become an accordion or collapsible panel.
