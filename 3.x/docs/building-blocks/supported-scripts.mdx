## Python

**Jython** is an implementation of the high-level, dynamic, object-oriented language [Python](http://www.python.org/) seamlessly integrated with the [Java](http://www.javasoft.com/) platform. Jython is an open-source solution.

### Properties

* Supports **Python 2.7** most common python libs can be imported, ex: math, time, etc.
* Java libs can also be imported: [details here ](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jython/jython_importing_java_libraries.htm)

## DMN

Decision Model and Notation (DMN) is a standard for Business Decision Management.

FLOWX uses [BPMN.io](https://bpmn.io/) (based on **camunda-engine-dmn** version **7.14.0**) which is built on [DMN 1.3](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/1.3/PDF) standards.

### Properties

**camunda-engine-dmn** supports [DMN 1.3](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/1.3/PDF), including Decision Tables, Decision Literal Expressions, Decision Requirements Graphs, and the Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL)

## MVEL

MVEL is a powerful expression language for Java-based applications. It provides a plethora of features and is suited for everything from the smallest property binding and extraction, to full-blown scripts.

* FLOWX uses [**mvel2 - 2.4.10 version**](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mvel/mvel2/2.4.10.Final)

## Groovy

Groovy is a multi-faceted language for the Java platform. The language can be used to combine Java modules, extend existing Java applications and write new applications

We use and recommend **Groovy 3.0.8** version, using **groovy-jsr223** engine.

<Info>
**Groovy** has multiple ways of integrating with Java, some of which provide richer options than available with **JSR-223** (e.g. greater configurability and more security control). **JSR-223** is recommended when you need to keep the choice of language used flexible and you don't require integration mechanisms not supported by **JSR-223**.
</Info>

<Info>
**JSR-223** (spec) is **a standard scripting API for Java Virtual Machine (JVM) languages** . The JVM languages provide varying levels of support for the JSR-223 API and interoperability with the Java runtime.
</Info>

## Nashorn Engine (JavaScript)

Nashorn engine is an open source implementation of the [ECMAScript Edition 5.1 Language Specification](https://es5.github.io/). It also implements many new features introduced in ECMAScript 6 including template strings; `let`, `const`, and block scope; iterators and `for..of` loops; `Map`, `Set`, `WeakMap`, and `WeakSet` data types; symbols; and binary and octal literals. It is written in Java and runs on the Java Virtual Machine.

Latest version of **Nashorn** is **15.4**, available from [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.openjdk.nashorn/nashorn-core/15.4/jar). You can check the [changelog](https://github.com/openjdk/nashorn/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to see what's new.
