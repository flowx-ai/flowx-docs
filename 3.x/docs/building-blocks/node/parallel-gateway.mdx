description: "Learn how to use Parallel Gateways to execute multiple operations concurrently in your process flow. This node type enables simultaneous execution of multiple paths, perfect for parallel processing, concurrent tasks, and multi-branch workflows. Each parallel section must be closed with another Parallel Gateway node."

## Configuring parallel paths

This node requires no special configuration and can initiate two or more parallel paths. It's important to note that the closing Parallel node, which is required to conclude the parallel section, will wait for all branches to complete before advancing to the next node.

### Configuration example

Let's consider a scenario involving a Paid Time Off (PTO) request. We have two distinct flows: one for the HR department and another for the manager. Initially, two tokens are generatedâ€”one for each parallel path. A third token is created when both parallel paths converge at the closing parallel gateway.

In the HR flow, in our example, the request is automatically approved.

Now, we await the second flow, which requires user input.

After the tokens from the parallel paths have completed their execution, a third token initiates from the closing parallel gateway.
