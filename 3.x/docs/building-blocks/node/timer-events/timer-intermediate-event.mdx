## Overview

A Timer Intermediate Event is a flow control element that pauses process execution until a specific time condition is met. It can be configured to trigger either at a specific date and time or after a specified duration.

## Configuring a Timer Intermediate Event

| Field      | Validations | Accepted Values                  |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| Definition | Mandatory   | ISO 8601 formats (date/duration) |
|            |             | Process param                    |

### Timer Types

#### 1. Date Timer
    
- Triggers the event on a specific date-time
- Uses ISO 8601 format
- Examples:
  - `2019-10-01T12:00:00Z` (UTC time)
  - `2019-10-02T08:09:40+02:00` (UTC plus two hours zone offset)

#### 2. Duration Timer

- Triggers the event after a specified duration
- Duration starts when the token reaches the timer node
- Example: `PT6S` (6 seconds duration)

### Definition Formats

The timer definition can be specified using:
* ISO 8601 format
* Cron expressions
* Process parameters

## General Rules and Behavior

1. **Trigger Mechanism**: Timer Intermediate Events activate based on their duration or date definition.
2. **Scheduler Operation**: When a token enters the Timer Intermediate Event:
   - A scheduler is automatically set
   - The process waits at this point
   - Execution continues after the timer triggers
3. **Process Flow**: After the timer condition is met, the process instance automatically continues along its defined path.
