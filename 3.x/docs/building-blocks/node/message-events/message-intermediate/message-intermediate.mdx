An intermediate event is an occurrence situated between a start and an end event in a process or system. It represents a significant point in the business process flow where messages are either sent or received. In BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), it is represented by a circle with a double line. This event can either catch or throw information, and the directional flow is indicated by connecting objects, determining whether the event is catching or throwing information.
