When you encounter a process definition menu, it encompasses the following essential elements:

1. **Process definition name**(*foodOrder_process*): This serves as the name of the process definition, providing a clear identifier for the workflow.
2. **Version - main (Work In Progress)**: This section displays both the version branch name and the current state of the published version. It offers insights into the active development state of the workflow.
3. **Branching Icon**: When selected, this icon opens up additional options to enhance visibility and control over the various process definitions and their branches.
4. **Submit Changes**: To commit alterations to the workflow, you can employ this designated action found within the version menu. Triggering the submission action prompts the appearance of a modal window, inviting you to provide a commit message for context.
5. **Autosaved**: This reassuring notification indicates that any modifications made to the workflow have been automatically saved, eliminating the need for manual user intervention. It ensures the safety of your work.
6. **Start**: This option signifies the ability to initiate the execution of a process definition, setting it in motion.
7. **Lock Icon**: Utilize this icon to switch the current work mode from "Edit mode" to "Readonly." It empowers you to control the accessibility and editing permissions for the workflow.

We have designed FLOWX.AI components to closely resemble their BPMN counterparts for ease of use. In the following sections, we will provide more details on how to use the process designer.

Check the following section for more details about nodes and how to use them:

## Process definition

The process is the core building block of the platform. Think of it as a representation of your business use case, for example making a request for a new credit card, placing an online food order, registering your new car or creating an online fundraiser supporting your cause.

A process is nothing more than a series of steps that need to be followed in order to get to the desired outcome: getting a new credit card, gathering online donations from friends or having your lunch brought to you. These steps involve a series of actions, whether automated or handled by a human, that allows you to complete your chosen business objective.

## Process instance

Once the desired processes are defined in the platform, they are ready to be used. Each time a process needs to be used, for example, each time a customer wants to request a new credit card, a new instance of the specified process definition is started in the platform. Think of the process definition as a blueprint for a house, and of the process instance as each house of that type that is being built.

From this point on, the platform takes care of following the process flow, handling the necessary actions, storing and interpreting the resulting data.
