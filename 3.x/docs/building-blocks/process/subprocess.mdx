title: Subprocess
description: Sub-processes are smaller process flows that can be triggered by actions in the main process. They can also inherit some process parameter values from the parent process and send their results back to the parent process when they are completed. The subprocesses will communicate with the front-end apps using the same connection details as their parent process.
---
Subprocesses can be started in two ways:

* **asynchronous** - they will execute alongside the parent process since the parent process does not need to wait for the sub-process to end
* **synchronous** - the parent process will wait until the sub-processes are finished before advancing

## Configuring & starting subprocesses

The sub-processes will be designed in the same way as the main process, by using the FLOWX Designer.

They can be started by a parent process in one of two ways:

* by using a StartSubprocess action inside any of the task nodes in the process
* by adding a custom Subprocess Run node type in the process

In both cases, by default, the sub-process will inherit all the parent process parameter values. It can be configured to inherit only some parameter values from its parent. The available action parameters for this are:

* _paramsToCopy_ - choose which of the keys from the parent process parameters to be copied to the sub-process
* _withoutParams_ - choose which of the keys from the parent process parameters are to be ignored when copying parameter values from the parent process to the sub-process

Sub-processes can have an action configured on them which will append their results to the parent process parameter values.

## Executing subprocesses

The sub-processes can be started in async or sync mode, by setting a specific action parameter, named _startedAsync,_ on the action that triggers the subprocess.

If the subprocesses are started in sync mode, they will notify the parent process when they are completed and the parent process will handle receiving the process data from the child and resuming its flow.
