## Introduction to NGINX

NGINX is a versatile web server that offers:
- High-performance web serving
- Reverse proxy capabilities
- Load balancing
- Mail proxy functionality
- HTTP caching
- Kubernetes integration

### How NGINX Works

NGINX allows you to hide a server application's complexity from a front-end application. It uses an event-driven, asynchronous approach to create a new process for each web request, with requests handled in a single thread.

### Using NGINX with FLOWX Designer

[**The NGINX Ingress Controller for Kubernetes**](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) - `ingress-nginx` is an ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer.

Ingress allows you to route requests to services based on the host or path of the request, centralizing a number of services into a single entry point.

The [ingress resource](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx-ingress-controller/nginx-ingress-resources/) simplifies the configuration of:
- **SSL/TLS termination**
- **HTTP load-balancing**
- **Layer routing**

#### Integrating with FLOWX Designer

FLOWX Designer uses the NGINX ingress controller for the following purposes:

1. **Plugin Routing**: Routing calls to plugins
2. **FLOWX Engine Integration**: For routing calls to the [FlowX Engine](../../../platform-deep-dive/core-components/flowx-engine):
   - Viewing current instances of processes running in the FLOWX engine
   - Testing process definitions from the FLOWX Designer - route the API calls and SSE communications to the FLOWX engine backend
   - Accessing REST API of the backend microservice
3. **SPA Configuration**: Configuring the Single Page Application (SPA) - FLOWX Designer SPA will use the backend service to manage the platform via REST calls
