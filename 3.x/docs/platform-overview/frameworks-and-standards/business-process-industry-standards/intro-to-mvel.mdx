## What is MVEL?

**MVFLEX Expression Language** (MVEL) is an expression language with a syntax similar to the Java programming language. This makes it relatively easy to use in order to define more complex business rules and that cannot be defined using DMN.

The runtime allows MVEL expressions to be executed either interpretively, or through a pre-compilation process with support for runtime byte-code generation to remove overhead. We pre-compile most of the MVEL code in order to make sure the process flow advances as fast as possible.

## Example

```java
if( input.get("user.credit_score") >= 700 ) { 
    output.setNextNodeName("TASK_SET_CREDIT_CARD_TYPE_PREMIUM"); 
} else { 
    output.setNextNodeName("TASK_SET_CREDIT_CARD_TYPE_STANDARD"); 
}
```
