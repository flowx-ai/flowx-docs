> **Warning:** These roles must be defined in the selected identity provider, such as Keycloak, Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO), or another compatible identity provider.

### Customizing Access Roles

In cases where additional custom roles are required, you can configure them using environment variables. Multiple roles can be assigned to each access scope as needed.

**Environment Variable Format:**

To configure access for each role, use the following format:

**`SECURITY_ACCESSAUTHORIZATIONS_AUTHORIZATIONNAME_SCOPES_SCOPENAME_ROLESALLOWED: NEEDED_ROLE_NAMES`**

* **Possible values for `AUTHORIZATIONNAME`:** `MANAGE_SYSTEMS`, `MANAGE_WORKFLOWS`.
* **Possible values for `SCOPENAME`:** `import`, `read`, `read_restricted`, `edit`, `admin`.

For example, to configure a custom role with read access to manage systems, use:

```plaintext
SECURITY_ACCESSAUTHORIZATIONS_MANAGE_SYSTEMS_SCOPES_READ_ROLESALLOWED: ROLE_CUSTOM_SYSTEM_READ
```
