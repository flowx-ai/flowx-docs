Once a Process Definition is created and published on the platform, it can be executed, monitored, and optimized. When a business process starts, a new Process Instance is created based on the Process Definition.

### Audit Log

In the top-right contextual menu, you will find the **Audit** feature containing the following information:

* Timestamp 
* User 
* Application Version
* Subject 
* Event 
* Subject Identifier 
* Status 

<Info>
Several items in the Audit Log are filterable, making it easy to track changes in the process.

## Data Model

In the Data Model, you can add new key-pair values. This feature enables you to use shortcuts when adding new keys using the UI Designer without switching between menus.

## Swimlanes

Swimlanes provide an effective method of organizing process nodes based on process participants. By using swimlanes, you can establish controlled access to specific process nodes for particular user roles.

#### Adding New Swimlanes

To add new swimlanes, follow these steps:

1. Access the **FlowX.AI Designer**
2. Open an existing Process Definition or create a new one
3. Locate the default swimlane and select it to display the contextual menu

</Frame>

<Tip>
The contextual menu allows you to perform various actions related to swimlanes, such as adding, removing, or reordering them.
</Tip>

4. Select the desired location for the new swimlane (below or above the default swimlane)
5. Click the **add swimlane icon** to create the new swimlane

## Settings

### Process Name

* **Process Definition Name**: Edit the Process Definition name

<Info>
Names can only contain letters, numbers, and the following special characters: [] () . _ -
</Info>

### General

In the General settings, you can edit the Process Definition name, include the process in reporting, set general data, and configure expiry time expressions using Cron Expressions and ISO 8601 formatting.

* **Available Platforms** (Single Choice): This setting enables configuration (Navigation Areas, UI Designer, Misconfigurations) only for the specific platform selected:

    - **Web Only**: Choose this option when navigation areas are defined exclusively for web usage. This ensures optimal functionality for web-based interactions.
    - **Mobile Only**: Select this when navigation areas are designed specifically for mobile devices, leveraging mobile-specific features and design considerations.
    - **Omnichannel**: Use this option when the process has navigation areas defined for both Web and Mobile platforms, ensuring a consistent experience across all platforms.

<Tip>
This setting is available starting with **v4.1.0** platform release.
</Tip>

<Info>
Navigation Areas, UI Designer, and misconfigurations will be affected by this setting.
</Info>

<Info>
By default, new processes are set to **Web Only**, providing an optimized starting point for web-based usage.
</Info>

* **Use Process in Reporting**: When enabled, this setting includes the process in reporting features
* **Use Process in Task Management**: Enabling this option creates tasks that appear in the Task Manager plugin. For more details, see the [**Task Management**](../../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/task-management/task-management-overview) section
* **General Data**: Customizable data that can be both set and received in a response context
* **Expiry Time**: Set up an expiry time expression on a Process Definition to specify an expiry date

| **Example**               | **Expression**         | **Explanation**                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Daily Expiry at Midnight  | `0 0 0 * * ?`          | Sets the process to expire at 00:00 (midnight) every day. The `?` is used in the day-of-week field to ignore its value. |
| Hourly Expiry on Weekdays | `0 0 9-17 * * MON-FRI` | Sets the process to expire at the start of each hour between 9 AM and 5 PM on weekdays (Monday to Friday).              |
| Expiry After a Duration   | `PT3M22S`              | Sets the process to expire after a duration of 3 minutes and 22 seconds from the start, using **ISO 8601 format**.      |

<Tip>
FlowX supports Spring Cron expressions. They **must always include six fields**: `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, `day of month`, `month`, and `day of week`.  
This differs from traditional UNIX Cron, which uses only five fields. Be sure to include the `seconds` field in Spring Cron expressions to avoid errors.
</Tip>

<Info>
The Cron expression format should include seconds (0), minutes (0), hours (0), and then wildcards for the day, month, and day of the week fields. The `?` sign in the day-of-week field is used when the day-of-month field is already specified (or ignored in this case).
</Info>

<Info>
You can use both ISO 8601 duration format (`PT3M22S`) and Cron expressions (`0 0 0 * * ?`, `0 0 9-17 * * MON-FRI`) to define `expiryTime` expressions for Process Definitions.
</Info>

For more information about **Cron Expressions** and **ISO 8601** formatting, check the following section:

### Permissions

After defining roles in the Identity Provider solution, they will be available for use in the Process Definition settings panel for configuring swimlane access. 

When creating a new swimlane, it comes with two default permissions assigned based on a specific role: execute and self-assign. Additional permissions can be added manually based on user requirements.

### Task Management

* **Use Process in Task Management**
    * This option enables the integration of a Process Definition with the Task Manager system
    * When activated, the process becomes available for managing tasks within Task Management, allowing data, tasks, and status updates to flow between the process and Task Manager
* **Application URL** 
    * The Application URL directs users to the specific application instance where a process is executed
    * It serves as a reference point for accessing and managing tasks associated with a process directly from Task Manager
    * Follows a standard format: `{baseURL}/appId/buildId/processes/resourceId/instance`
    * Can be dynamically defined using configuration parameters (e.g., `${genericParameter}`) or set at the process data level using business rules
* **Keys to Send to Task Manager**
    * Specifies the data fields (keys) from a Process Definition that are sent to Task Manager for indexing and display
    * These keys customize task-related views, filters, and parameters for effective task management

<Tip>
Important:

* Keys must exist in the Process Data Model
* Keys require re-indexing if their type or structure is updated in the Data Model
</Tip>

</Frame>

### Data Search

The **Search Indexing** tab allows you to configure process data keys used for indexing data stored in a process. These keys enable efficient searching and filtering of Process Instances based on the indexed data.

</Frame>

<Tip>
Process Data Keys: These are paths or fields in the Process Definition that store relevant data. For example, customerDetails.fullName might correspond to a field capturing the full name of a customer.
