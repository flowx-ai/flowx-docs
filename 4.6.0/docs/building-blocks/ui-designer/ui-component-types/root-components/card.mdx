## Styling

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web">
<Tabs>
<Tab title ="Layout">

When designing for the web, consider the layout options available for the card. These options include:

* **Direction**: Choose between **Horizontal** or **Vertical** alignment to define the flow of components. For example, select Horizontal for a left-to-right layout.
* **Justify (H)**: Specify how content is aligned along the main axis. For instance, select end to align items to the end of the card.
* **Align (V)**: Align components vertically within their card using options such as top, center, or bottom alignment.
* **Wrap**: Enable wrapping to automatically move items to the next line when they reach the end of the card. Useful for creating multi-line layouts.
* **Gap**: Define the space between components to control the distance between each item. Adjusting the gap enhances visual clarity and organization.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Sizing">

Adjusting the size of components is crucial for a responsive design. Fit W (width) offers three options:

    * **fill**: Fills the available space.
    * **fixed**: Maintains a fixed width.
    * **auto**: Adjusts the width automatically based on content.

Similar styling considerations apply to iOS as for web.

However, for mobile applications, there's an additional layout style property specific to cards when used as the root component:

* **Scrollable**:  This property allows you to define the desired behavior of the screen, specifying whether it should be scrollable or not. By default, this property is set to true, enabling scrolling functionality.

## Validating elements

To ensure the validation of all form elements and custom components within a card upon executing a Save Data action such as **Submit** or **Continue**, follow these steps:

1. When adding a UI action to a button inside a card, locate the dropdown menu labeled **Add forms to submit**.
2. From the dropdown menu, select the specific forms, individual form elements, or custom components you wish to validate.
3. If you select custom components, ensure they are properly configured to handle validation and data saving responsibilities.

### Custom component validation

UI actions enable validation and data management for custom components alongside form elements. This provides flexibility if you want to design custom components for entire screens, such as custom forms not natively supported by the platform.

#### Key features

- **Validation API**: The renderer provides a public API for validating custom components before triggering an action.
- **Custom Component Responsibilities**:
  - Validate custom forms and return a boolean (`true` for valid, `false` for invalid).
  - Display validation errors in the UI for invalid data.
  - Populate a `saveData` property with the structured data to be submitted.
- **Configurator Responsibilities**:
  - Select custom components in the **Add forms to submit** dropdown when configuring a UI action.
  - Set the custom key to store the data submitted by the custom component.

By including custom components in the validation process, you can now validate and retrieve data from custom form sections, ensuring comprehensive and reliable form submission.
