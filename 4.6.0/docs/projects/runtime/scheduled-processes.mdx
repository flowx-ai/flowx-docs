title: Scheduled processes
description: Automate the initiation of process instances using predefined timer settings. Scheduled Processes trigger workflows on specific dates, times, or intervals without manual intervention.
---

## Overview

The **Scheduled Processes** feature automatically triggers process instances using Timer Start Events. You configure timers at the process definition level and manage them from the **Runtime** tab—no redeployment needed. This feature is especially useful in upper environments, where you might need to pause or resume cron jobs without modifying the application build.

## Key components

### 1. List of scheduled processes

The **Scheduled Processes** tab displays all timers that trigger process instances. Each row in the list shows:

- **Process Name:** The process linked to the timer.
- **Swimlane Name:** In multi-swimlane processes, each swimlane may have its own timer.
- **Timer Name:** The unique identifier for the timer.
- **Timer Type:**  
  - **Date-based:** Triggers at a specific date and time.  
  - **Cycle-based:** Repeats at defined intervals (for example, every 10 seconds).
- **Location:** The execution environment (e.g., **Local**).

From this interface, you can view timer details or activate/deactivate timers as needed.


### 2. Timer Events schedule 

To view a timer’s configuration, click the **View** icon next to the scheduled timer in the list.

## Use cases 


<Steps>
<Step title="Employee Onboarding reminder">

A Timer Start Event can be scheduled to **automatically trigger** an onboarding process at a predefined time.  

**Example**: Process starts on **January 28, 2025, at 12:14 PM**, sending onboarding notifications.  

</Step>

<Step title="Recurring Data processing jobs">

A Cycle timer can execute a job **every 10 seconds for 60 repetitions**, ensuring periodic execution.  

</Step>


<Step title="Scheduled Report generation">

A cycle timer with a cron expression can generate a report at **1 AM every day**.  

</Step>

## Additional notes

- **Runtime Timer Control:**  
  Manage timers in the **Runtime** tab without changing the application build. Previously, timer activation was controlled by a checkbox in the **Start Timer node**, which is now read-only after deployment.

- **Timers in Multi-Swimlane Processes:**  
  Each swimlane can have its own timer. The **Scheduled Processes** tab displays each timer separately for clear management.

- **Exporting and Importing Builds:**  
  Timer activation settings are not editable during build export/import. All timer management occurs in the **Runtime** tab.
