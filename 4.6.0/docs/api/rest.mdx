title: Process status
api: 'GET {ENGINE_URL}/api/process/{PROCESS_INSTANCE_ID}/status'
---

Processes can be started by making an API call. Certain parameters needed by the process can be sent on the request body.

Some special cases for stating process instances are:

* starting a process instance from another instance and inhering some data from the first one to the second
* a process can have multiple start nodes, in which case, a start condition must be set when making the start process call

 The name of the process definition to instantiate.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="ENGINE_URL" type="string"  required>
The URL of the engine.
