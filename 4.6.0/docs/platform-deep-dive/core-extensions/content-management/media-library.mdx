## Icons

The Icons feature allows you to customize icons used in UI elements. By uploading SVG files through the Media Library and marking them as icons, you can select them from the available list in the UI Designer.

<Info>
When selecting icons in the UI Designer, only SVG files marked as icons in the Media Library will be available.
</Info>

<Info>
For optimal visual rendering and alignment within UI elements, use icons with standard sizes: 16px, 24px, or 32px.

Using icons specifically designed for these sizes helps maintain consistency and ensures a visually pleasing user interface. Select icons from icon sets that provide these size options or resize icons proportionally to fit these dimensions.

<Warning>
Icons are displayed at their original, inherent size.
</Warning>
</Info>

### Customization

Content-specific icons enhance UI elements such as [input fields](../../../building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/input-form-field) or [send message buttons](../../../building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/buttons). These icons are readily available in the [UI Designer](../../../building-blocks/ui-designer/).
