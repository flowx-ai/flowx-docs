# Understanding Documentation Snippets

Documentation snippets are reusable blocks of content that help you maintain consistency and reduce duplication across your documentation. They follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, making your documentation more maintainable and easier to update.

## What are Snippets?

Snippets are modular pieces of documentation that you can:
- Import and reuse across multiple pages
- Update in one place to reflect changes everywhere
- Use to maintain consistent messaging and styling

  - **Consistency**: Ensure uniform messaging and styling
  - **Maintainability**: Update content in one place
  - **Efficiency**: Reduce time spent on repetitive documentation
  - **Quality**: Minimize the risk of inconsistencies and errors
</Card>

## How Snippets Work

Snippets are stored in the `snippets` directory and can be imported into any MDX documentation file. Here's a simple example:

<CodeGroup>
```mdx snippet-file.mdx
<Note>
  This is a reusable note that can be used across multiple documentation pages.
  It will always look and read the same way.
</Note>
```

```mdx usage-example.mdx
import ReusableNote from 'snippets/snippet-file.mdx';

# My Documentation Page

<ReusableNote />
```
</CodeGroup>

## When to Use Snippets

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Common UI Elements" icon="palette">
    Use snippets for warnings, notes, tips, or any other UI components that should look consistent throughout your documentation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Repeated Content" icon="copy">
    If you find yourself writing the same information in multiple places, that's a perfect candidate for a snippet.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Version Information" icon="code-compare">
    Use snippets for version-specific warnings or compatibility notes that might need to be updated across multiple pages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Standardized Messages" icon="message-lines">
    Create snippets for common messages like deprecation warnings, beta features, or requirement notes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Keep your snippets focused and single-purpose. It's better to have multiple small, specific snippets than one large, complex snippet.
</Tip>

1. **Name snippets clearly** - Use descriptive names that indicate the snippet's purpose
2. **Document your snippets** - Include comments about when and how to use each snippet
3. **Keep them maintainable** - Regularly review and update snippets to ensure they remain relevant
4. **Version control** - Track changes to snippets just like you would with code

## Getting Started

To create a new snippet:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new file">
    Create a new `.mdx` file in your `snippets` directory
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your content">
    Write your reusable content using MDX syntax
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import and use">
    Import the snippet into any documentation page where you need it
  </Step>
</Steps>

By using snippets effectively, you can create more maintainable documentation that's easier to keep up-to-date and consistent across your entire documentation set.
