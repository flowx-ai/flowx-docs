# Adding Snippets to Documentation

Snippets are reusable MDX components that help maintain consistency and reduce duplication across your documentation. Here's how to create and use them:

## Creating a Snippet

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in the `snippets` directory
2. Write your MDX content directly - no need for explicit exports or function declarations
3. Import and use the snippet in other MDX files

## Example

Let's create a simple alert component as a snippet:

```mdx snippets/alert.mdx
<div className="bg-blue-100 border-l-4 border-blue-500 text-blue-700 p-4 mb-4 rounded">
  {children}
</div>
```

### Using the Snippet

Import and use your snippet in any MDX documentation file:

```mdx
import Alert from 'snippets/alert.mdx';

# My Documentation Page

<Alert>
  This is an important message that will be consistently styled across the docs.
</Alert>
```

## Best Practices

<Info>
  Keep snippet files focused and single-purpose. Each snippet should do one thing well.

<Tip>
  Name your snippet files descriptively to make them easy to find and understand their purpose.
</Tip>

## Common Use Cases

Snippets are great for:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="UI Components" icon="palette">
    Alerts, callouts, warning boxes, and other styled elements
  </Card>
  <Card title="Repeated Content" icon="copy">
    Common explanations, warnings, or notes that appear in multiple places
  </Card>
  <Card title="Version Notices" icon="code-branch">
    Version-specific warnings or compatibility notices
  </Card>
  <Card title="API Examples" icon="code">
    Consistent API usage examples across endpoints
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Advanced Usage

You can pass props to your snippets just like any other React component:

```mdx snippets/status-badge.mdx
<span className={`px-2 py-1 rounded-full text-sm ${props.type === 'success' ? 'bg-green-100 text-green-800' : 'bg-red-100 text-red-800'}`}>
  {props.children}
</span>
```

Then use it with props:

```mdx
import StatusBadge from 'snippets/status-badge.mdx';

<StatusBadge type="success">Active</StatusBadge>
```

<Note>
  Remember that snippets are automatically wrapped in a component, so you can access props directly without defining them explicitly.
