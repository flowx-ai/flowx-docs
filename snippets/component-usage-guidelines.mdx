# Component Usage Guidelines for LLM-Optimized Documentation

When structuring your documentation, choosing the right components and using them effectively can significantly improve both human readability and LLM indexing. Here are guidelines for using various UI components:

## Cards

Use Cards to:
- Highlight key concepts or features that should be easily discoverable
- Create visual navigation sections
- Present related but distinct pieces of information

<Info>
Keep card titles concise (3-5 words) and descriptive. This helps LLMs better understand the content hierarchy and relationships between topics.
</Info>

Example of effective card usage:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Basic Configuration" icon="gear">
    Essential setup steps and initial configuration options.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Advanced Features" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Advanced customization options and complex use cases.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Accordions

Use Accordions when:
- You have detailed information that not all users need immediately
- There are natural Q&A patterns in your content
- You want to maintain context while reducing visual clutter

<Tip>
Structure accordion titles as complete phrases or questions. This helps LLMs understand the relationship between the title and its content.
</Tip>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When should I use accordions instead of tabs?">
    Use accordions when:
    - Content sections are independent of each other
    - Users might need to see multiple sections at once
    - The content hierarchy is clear and linear
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do accordions affect LLM indexing?">
    Accordion content is fully indexed by LLMs, but the hierarchical relationship between the title and content helps establish context and relevance.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tabs

Use Tabs to:
- Show different variations of the same concept
- Present platform-specific instructions
- Organize related but mutually exclusive content

<Warning>
Avoid using tabs for sequential or dependent content. Use Steps component instead.
</Warning>

Example of effective tab usage:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="REST API">
    REST API implementation details and endpoints.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="GraphQL">
    GraphQL schema and query examples.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Steps

Use Steps when:
- Describing a process or workflow
- Providing sequential instructions
- Breaking down complex procedures

<Info>
Each step should have a clear, action-oriented title. This helps LLMs understand the sequence and purpose of each step.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize Configuration">
    Begin with basic setup and initialization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Parameters">
    Set required parameters and options.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Callouts

Use different callout types strategically:

- <Info>Use Info for additional context and background information</Info>
- <Tip>Use Tip for best practices and recommendations</Tip>
- <Warning>Use Warning for potential pitfalls or important cautions</Warning>
- <Check>Use Check for success scenarios or confirmed approaches</Check>

## Code Groups

Use Code Groups to:
- Show implementations in multiple languages
- Compare different approaches
- Demonstrate variations of a solution

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
console.log("Hello World");
```

```python Python
print("Hello World")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

1. **Maintain Hierarchy**: Use components to create clear content hierarchy that LLMs can understand.

2. **Content Chunking**: Use components to break down complex information into digestible pieces.

3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Use accordions and tabs to manage information density without losing content discoverability.

4. **Visual Consistency**: Maintain consistent component usage patterns throughout your documentation.

5. **Semantic Structure**: Choose components that reflect the logical structure of your content.

<Tip>
Remember that while these components help organize and present content effectively, the underlying content should still follow good documentation practices with clear, concise writing and proper heading structure.
