# Introduction to Snippets

One of the core principles of software development is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). This principle applies to documentation as well. If you find yourself repeating the same content in multiple places, you should consider creating a custom snippet to keep your content in sync.

## What are Snippets?

Snippets are reusable blocks of MDX content that can be imported and used across your documentation, similar to how you would use React components. They help maintain consistency and reduce duplication in your documentation.

## Creating Snippets

Snippets are stored in the `snippets` directory of your documentation. To create a new snippet:

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in the `snippets` folder
2. Write your MDX content directly - no need for explicit function declarations
3. The content will automatically be wrapped in a component

<CodeGroup>
```mdx snippets/warning-box.mdx
<div className="bg-yellow-100 border-yellow-400 rounded-lg p-4">
  <div className="flex">
    <Icon icon="triangle-exclamation" className="text-yellow-400" />
    <div className="ml-3">
      This is a warning message.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
</CodeGroup>

## Using Snippets

To use a snippet in your documentation:

1. Import the snippet at the top of your MDX file
2. Use it like any other React component

<CodeGroup>
```mdx example-usage.mdx
import WarningBox from 'snippets/warning-box.mdx';

# My Documentation Page

<WarningBox />
```
</CodeGroup>

## Tips for Effective Snippet Usage

<Tip>
  Keep your snippets modular and focused on a single responsibility. This makes them more reusable and easier to maintain.
</Tip>

<Info>
  Snippets can accept props just like regular React components, making them flexible and adaptable to different contexts.
</Info>

<Warning>
  Avoid creating snippets for content that's likely to change frequently or needs to be highly customized for each use case.
</Warning>

By using snippets effectively, you can:
- Maintain consistency across your documentation
- Reduce the time spent updating repeated content
- Ensure a unified voice and style
- Make your documentation more maintainable
