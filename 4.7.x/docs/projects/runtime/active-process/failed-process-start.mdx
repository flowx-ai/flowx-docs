---

Exceptions are types of errors meant to help you debug a failure in the execution of a process.

Exceptions can be accessed from multiple places:

* **Failed process start** tab from **Active process** menu in FlowX.AI Designer.
* **Process Status** view, accessible from **Process instances** list in FlowX.AI Designer.

<Hint>
If you open a process instance and it does not contain exceptions, the **Exceptions** tab will not be displayed.

### Exceptions data

When you click **view** button, a detailed exception will be displayed.

</Frame>

* **Process Definition**: The process where the exception was thrown.
* **Source**: The source of the exception (see the possible type of [sources](#possible-sources) below).
* **Message**: A hint type of message to help you understand what's wrong with your process.
* **Type**: Exception type.
* **Cause Type**: Cause type (or the name of the node if it is the case).
* **Process Instance UUID**: Process instance unique identifier (UUID).
* **Token UUID**: The token unique identifier.
* **Timestamp**: The default format is - `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ`.
* **Details**: Stack trace (a **stack trace** is a list of the method calls that the process was in the middle of when an **Exception** was thrown).

### Exceptions type

Based on the exception type, there are multiple causes that could make a process fail. Here are some examples:

| Type                     | Cause                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Business Rule Evaluation | When executing action rules fails for any reason.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Condition Evaluation     | When executing action conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Engine                   | <p></p><p>When the connection with the database fails</p><p>when the connection with [Redis](../../../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-redis) fails</p><p></p> |
| Definition               | Misconfigurations: process def name, subprocess parent process id value, start node condition missing.                                                                                                              |
| Node                     | When an outgoing node can’t be found (missing sequence etc).                                                                                                                                                        |
| Gateway Evaluation       | <p>When the token can’t pass a gateway for any reason, possible causes:</p><ul><li>Missing sequence/node</li><li>Failed node rule</li></ul>                                                                         |
| Subprocess               | Exceptions will be saved for them just like for any other process, parent process ID will also be saved (we can use this to link them when displaying exceptions).                                                  |
