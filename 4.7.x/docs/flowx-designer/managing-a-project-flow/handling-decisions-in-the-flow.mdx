title: Handling decisions in the flow
description: Learn how to implement conditional branching in your processes using exclusive gateways to create dynamic, decision-driven workflows.
---

Business processes often require making decisions based on data and conditions. FlowX.AI's exclusive gateway nodes allow you to create branching paths in your process flow, directing the execution based on specific conditions and business rules.

## What is an exclusive gateway?

<Card title="Exclusive Gateway" icon="diamond">
An exclusive gateway (also known as an XOR gateway) creates conditional branches in your process flow. It directs the process token to exactly one of the outgoing paths based on evaluated conditions. Think of it as an "if-then-else" decision point in your process.

## How exclusive gateways work

<Frame caption="Process Flow with Exclusive Gateway">
![Exclusive Gateway Example](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/xclsv_mapf.png)
</Frame>

Exclusive gateways function as decision points in your process:

1. When the process flow reaches an exclusive gateway, it evaluates conditions associated with each outgoing path
2. The first condition that evaluates to `true` determines which path is taken
3. Only one path is followed, even if multiple conditions could evaluate to `true`
4. A default path can be specified to be taken if no conditions are met

<Info>
Best practice is to always provide a default path to ensure your process doesn't get stuck if none of the specified conditions are met.

## Creating a flow with exclusive branches

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or Open a Process Definition">
    1. Open **FlowX.AI Designer** and navigate to your project
    2. Go to the **Processes** section and select your process or create a new one
    3. Click the **Edit Process** button to open the Process Designer
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Basic Flow Elements">
    1. Add a **Start Node** to your process canvas (if creating a new process)
    2. Add a node before your decision point (typically a task or user task node)
    3. Ensure the necessary data for your decision is available in the process at this point
    
    <Tip>
      The decision conditions will evaluate data that's already in your process context, so make sure any required data is collected or calculated before reaching the gateway.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add the Decision Gateway">
    1. From the node palette, drag an **Exclusive Gateway** node onto your canvas
    2. Connect your previous node to this gateway
    3. Give your gateway a descriptive name that indicates its decision purpose (e.g., "Evaluate Credit Score")
    
    <Warning>
      You must connect all outgoing paths from the exclusive gateway before configuring the decision conditions.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Outgoing Paths">
    1. Add the task nodes that will be the targets for each decision branch
    2. Connect the exclusive gateway to each of these nodes using sequence flows
    3. Name each sequence flow to indicate the condition (e.g., "Premium Card Path", "Standard Card Path")

      ![Gateway Condition Configuration](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/mapf_gateway_condition.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Decision Conditions">
    1. Select one of the sequence flows (arrows) from the gateway
    2. In the properties panel, navigate to the **Condition** section
    3. Select a **scripting language** from the dropdown (e.g., MVEL, JavaScript)
    4. Enter your condition expression, for example:
    
    ```javascript
    input.get("application.client.creditScore") >= 700
    ```
    
    5. Repeat for each outgoing path with the appropriate condition:
    
    ```javascript
    input.get("application.client.creditScore") < 700
    ```
    
    <Info>
      Conditions are evaluated in the order they appear in the Designer. The first condition that evaluates to `true` determines the path taken, so order matters!
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Converging Gateway (Optional)">
    If your branches need to converge back to a single flow:
    
    1. Add another **Exclusive Gateway** after your branch tasks
    2. Connect each branch endpoint to this converging gateway
    3. Continue the process flow from this gateway
    
    <Note>
      A converging exclusive gateway doesn't require conditions since it's merely joining paths rather than splitting them.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete the Process Flow">
    1. Add any additional nodes needed after the decision branches
    2. Ensure your process eventually reaches an **End Node**
    3. Save your process definition
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Condition expression examples

Here are some example condition expressions for different decision scenarios:

  <Accordion title="Numeric Comparisons">
    ```javascript
    // Check if age is over 18
    input.get("customer.age") >= 18
    
    // Check if balance is sufficient
    input.get("account.balance") > input.get("transaction.amount")
    
    // Check if score is within a range
    input.get("application.score") >= 600 && input.get("application.score") < 750
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="String Comparisons">
    ```javascript
    // Check customer type
    input.get("customer.type") == "premium"
    
    // Check if country is in EU
    ["DE", "FR", "IT", "ES"].contains(input.get("customer.country"))
    
    // Check if name starts with specific letters
    input.get("customer.lastName").startsWith("A")
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Boolean logic">
    ```javascript
    // Check multiple conditions with AND
    input.get("customer.verified") == true && input.get("customer.active") == true
    
    // Check multiple conditions with OR
    input.get("application.status") == "pending" || input.get("application.status") == "review"
    
    // Complex condition with nested logic
    (input.get("customer.age") >= 21 || (input.get("customer.age") >= 18 && input.get("customer.parentalConsent") == true)) && input.get("customer.verified") == true
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Date Comparisons">
    ```javascript
    // Check if membership is expired
    new java.text.SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd").parse(input.get("membership.expiryDate")).before(new java.util.Date())
    
    // Check if account is older than 1 year
    dateDiffInDays(new java.text.SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd").parse(input.get("account.openDate")), new java.util.Date()) > 365
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best practices

<Tip>
**When implementing decision logic:**

- **Use clear, descriptive names** for gateways and sequence flows to document the decision logic
- **Keep conditions simple and focused** on a single aspect of the decision
- **Ensure conditions are mutually exclusive** when possible to avoid ambiguity
- **Always provide a default path** to handle unexpected scenarios
- **Test each decision branch** with various input data to verify correct routing
- **Document complex decision logic** in the process documentation or node descriptions
- **Consider using business rule actions** before the gateway for complex evaluations
</Tip>
