## Understanding UI design in FlowX.AI

<Card title="UI Design Concepts" icon="palette">
In FlowX.AI, user interfaces are primarily associated with **User Task** nodes in your process flow. Each User Task can represent a screen or part of a screen in your application. The UI Designer provides a visual editor where you can add, arrange, and configure UI components to create your desired interface.

## Creating a process with user interfaces

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Process Definition">
    1. Open **FlowX.AI Designer** and navigate to your project
    2. Go to the **Processes** section and click **+ New Process**
    3. Give your process a descriptive name and click **Create**
    
    <Tip>
      Plan your user interface flow before starting. Consider how many screens you need and how users will navigate between them.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Process Flow Nodes">
    1. Add a **Start Node** to your process canvas
    2. Add **User Task** nodes for each screen in your application
    3. Connect the nodes in the sequence users will navigate through them
    4. Add an **End Node** to complete your process
    
    <Frame caption="Process Flow with User Tasks">
      ![User Interface Process](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/create_ui.png)
    </Frame>
    
    <Note>
      Each User Task node represents a screen or a significant UI interaction in your application. Design your process flow to match your intended user journey.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a Navigation Area">
    1. With your process open in edit mode, click the **Navigation** tab
    2. Click the **+ Add** button to create a new navigation area
    3. Select **Page** as the navigation type (or another type based on your needs)
    4. Name your navigation area (e.g., "Main Application Page")
    5. Assign the relevant User Task nodes to this navigation area

      ![Create Navigation Area](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/create_ui1.gif)
    </Frame>
    
    <Info>
      **Available Navigation Area Types:**
      
      - **Stepper**: Breaks progress into logical, numbered steps for intuitive navigation
      - **Tab Bar**: Allows users to switch between different sections or views
      - **Page**: Displays full-page content for an immersive experience
      - **Modal**: Overlays that require user interaction before returning to the main interface
      - **Zone**: Groups specific navigation areas or tasks, like headers and footers
      - **Parent Process Area**: Supports subprocess design under a parent hierarchy
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring the UI

All visual properties of UI elements and navigation areas are configured using the FlowX.AI UI Designer, which provides a visual editor for building your interfaces.

### Selecting navigation type

To begin, you need to define the type of navigation for your application:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Navigation Type">
    1. In the UI Designer, go to the navigation configuration section
    2. Select one of the following navigation types:
       - **Single page form**: For simple, one-page applications
       - **Wizard**: For multi-step processes with clear progression
    
    <Frame caption="Navigation Type Selection">
      ![Navigation Type](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/create_ui3.png)
    </Frame>
    
    <Info>
      For this example, we'll use the **Wizard** type, which is ideal for multi-step processes like applications or onboarding flows.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Designing the first screen

Let's configure the first User Task node to create an engaging and functional screen:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the UI Designer">
    1. In your process diagram, select the first **User Task** node
    2. Click the **UI Designer** button in the properties panel
    3. This will open the visual UI Designer for this specific node
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add a Card Component">
    1. From the component palette, drag a **Card** component onto the canvas
    2. The Card component will serve as a container for your form elements
    3. Configure the card's appearance using the properties panel (size, padding, etc.)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add a Form Component">
    1. Drag a **Form** component into the Card
    2. Forms help organize inputs and handle data binding
    3. Configure the form's properties as needed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Input Fields">
    1. Drag an **Input** component into the Form
    2. Configure the input's properties:
       - Set a label (e.g., "Full Name")
       - Choose the input type (text, number, email, etc.)
       - Configure validation rules if needed
       - Set the data binding to store user input
    
    <Frame caption="First Card Design">
      ![First Card UI](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/ui_card1.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add a Button with Action">
    1. Drag a **Button** component into the Form
    2. Configure the button text (e.g., "Continue" or "Next")
    3. Set up the button's action to trigger process advancement
    
    <Info>
      Before the button will work, you need to configure an action on the User Task node itself. This action will be triggered when the button is clicked.
    </Info>

    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Testing the first screen

<Steps>
  <Step title="Preview Your Screen">
    1. Save your UI design
    2. Start the process to test the UI
    3. The Card with the Form and Input field should be displayed as configured

    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Designing the second screen

Follow a similar process to design your second screen:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure the Second User Task">
    1. Select the second **User Task** node in your process
    2. Open the **UI Designer**
    3. Add a **Card** component
    4. Add other UI components as needed (text, inputs, buttons, etc.)
    
    <Frame caption="Second Card Design">
      ![Second Card UI](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/create_ui4.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Navigation Actions">
    1. Add a button to submit the form or continue to the next step
    2. Configure actions on the User Task node as needed
    3. Consider adding a "Back" button if appropriate for your flow
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing the complete flow

Once you've configured all your screens, test the complete process flow:
