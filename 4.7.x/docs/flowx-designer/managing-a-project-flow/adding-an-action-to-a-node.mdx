description: Learn how to enhance your process flows by adding actions to nodes for business rules, data management, and integration with external systems.
---


Actions are powerful elements that bring your process nodes to life by adding business logic, data management capabilities, and integration with external systems. They define the specific activities that nodes perform within your process flow.

## What is a node action?

<Card title="Node Action" icon="circle-question">
A node action defines the specific activity that a node performs within a process flow. Actions allow you to incorporate business rules, manage data, communicate with external systems, and control what gets displayed in the user interface. They are the building blocks that drive your process logic and user interactions.

## Action types

FlowX.AI supports several types of actions that can be added to nodes, broadly categorized into business rules and user interactions:

### Business rules and data management

  <Card title="Business Rule" icon="code">
    Add custom logic and decision-making using scripts
  </Card>
  <Card title="Save Data" icon="database">
    Persist process data to storage
  </Card>
  <Card title="Kafka Send" icon="paper-plane">
    Send messages to Kafka topics for event-driven scenarios
  </Card>
  <Card title="Upload File" icon="file-arrow-up">
    Handle file uploads within the process flow
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Process control and integration

  </Card>
  <Card title="Append Params to Parent Process" icon="arrow-up-right-dots">

</CardGroup>

### User interface

<Note>
Actions can only be added to certain node types:
- Task nodes (Service Tasks)
- User Task nodes
- Send Message/Receive Message Task nodes
</Note>

## Adding an action to a node

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your Process Definition">
    1. Open **FlowX.AI Designer** and navigate to your project
    2. Go to the **Processes** section within your project
    3. Select your process definition from the list
    4. Click the **Edit Process** button to open the Process Designer
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select or Add a Node">
    1. Either select an existing node that supports actions, or add a new one
    2. Remember that only Task nodes, User Task nodes, and Message Task nodes support actions
    
    <Info>
      If you need to add a new node first, refer to the [Adding a New Node](../managing-a-process-flow/adding-a-new-node) documentation.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add an Action">
    1. With the node selected, locate the **Actions** section in the properties panel
    2. Click the **+ Add Action** button
    3. From the dropdown menu, select the action type you want to add

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Action Parameters">
    Each action type requires specific configuration parameters:
    
    1. Fill in the required fields for your selected action type
    2. Configure optional parameters as needed
    3. Save your changes

    </Frame>
    
    <Warning>
      Pay careful attention to parameter syntax and formatting. Incorrect configurations may cause the action to fail during process execution.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Action Execution Order (Multiple Actions)">
    If you have multiple actions on a single node:
    
    1. Use the drag handles to arrange the actions in the desired execution order
    2. Actions will execute from top to bottom in the list
    3. Consider dependencies between actions when setting the order
    
    <Tip>
      For complex nodes with multiple actions, consider adding comments in scripts or descriptions to document the purpose and dependencies of each action.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Your Process">
    Click the **Save** button to save your process definition with the new action.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common action configurations

Different action types require different configurations, but many share these common elements:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Business Rule Action">
    - **Name**: Descriptive identifier for the rule
    - **Script Type**: JavaScript or other supported languages
    - **Script Content**: The business logic to execute
    - **Input Parameters**: Data inputs to the script
    - **Output Parameters**: Data returned from the script
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Save Data Action">
    - **Process Variables**: The data to be saved
    - **Target Storage**: Where the data should be persisted
    - **Data Mapping**: How process data maps to storage fields
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Kafka Send Action">
    - **Topic**: The Kafka topic to send messages to
    - **Key**: Identifier for the message
    - **Value**: The data payload to send
    - **Headers**: Additional message metadata
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Send Data to UI Action">
    - **UI Component**: The target component to update
    - **Data**: The information to display
    - **Formatting**: Display options for the data
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best practices

<Tip>
**When adding actions to nodes:**

- **Use meaningful action names** to clearly indicate their purpose
- **Keep business rules focused** on a single responsibility
- **Document complex logic** with comments in your scripts
- **Consider error handling** in your action configurations
- **Test actions individually** before relying on them in production flows
- **Monitor performance** of actions that might be resource-intensive
- **Use consistent data structure** across related actions for better maintainability
</Tip>
