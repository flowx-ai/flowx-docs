Once you've designed your process definitions, you'll need to know how to start process instances. FlowX.AI provides multiple ways to initiate processes, from manual user-triggered starts to fully automated system-initiated flows.

## Starting a process via Kafka


One of the most powerful ways to initiate processes is through Kafka messaging, which allows systems to communicate and trigger processes without direct user interaction.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your Project">
    1. Open **FlowX.AI Designer** and navigate to your project
    2. Select an existing process definition or create a new one that will send the Kafka message
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add a Send Message Task">
    1. Add a **Send Message Task** node to your process flow
    2. Attach a **Kafka Send Action** to this node
    
    <Tip>
      This task will send the message that initiates another process. You can place it at any appropriate point in your process flow.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure the Kafka Topic">
    1. In the Kafka Send Action configuration, specify the topic linked to the `KAFKA_TOPIC_PROCESS_START_BY_NAME` environment variable
    2. This variable is shared between the **application-manager** and **runtime-manager** deployments
    
    <Frame caption="Process Start Topic Configuration">
      ![Process Start Topic Configuration](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/start_process_by_name_topic.png)
    </Frame>
    
    <Info>
      To verify the topic in FlowX Designer, navigate to: **Platform status → FlowX Components → application-manager-mngt -> kafkaTopicHealthCheckIndicator → details → configuration → topic → process → start-by-name**
      
      <Frame caption="Topic Verification">
        ![Topic Verification](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/topic_kafka.png)
      </Frame>
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Message Content">
    Add any required data in the message body that should be passed to the new process:
    
    ```json
    {"test": "something"}
    ```
    
    <Note>
      This data will be available to the process being started, providing it with initial context or parameters.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Required Headers">
    1. Expand the **Advanced Configuration** section
    2. In the headers section, add these required headers:
       - `Fx-ProcessName`: The name of the process you want to start
       - `Fx-AppId`: The ID of the project (application) where the process resides
       - `jwt`: Your JWT token for authentication
    
    <Frame caption="Headers Configuration">
      ![Headers Configuration](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/start_process_by_name_headers.png)
    </Frame>
    
    The headers should look something like this:
    
    ```json
    {
      "Fx-ProcessName": "test_kafka",
      "Fx-AppId": "afcc6452-f50e-4d95-ae3b-6b35caed68bd",
      "jwt": "your_jwt"
    }
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      Without an active policy and proper authentication, the process may not start even if the Kafka message is correctly configured.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test and Monitor">
    1. Run your process to send the Kafka message
    2. To monitor the results, you can use tools like AKHQ to check the response on the `KAFKA_TOPIC_PROCESS_START_BY_NAME_OUT` topic
    
    <Frame caption="Kafka Response Monitoring">

    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Timer start event


Timer Start Events allow you to schedule processes to start automatically at defined times or intervals, enabling automated workflows without manual intervention.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure a Process with Timer Start">
    1. Open **FlowX.AI Designer** and navigate to your project
    2. Select an existing process definition or create a new one
    3. Add a **Start Timer Event** to your process instead of a regular Start node
    
    <Frame caption="Timer Start Event Configuration">
      ![Timer Start Event Configuration](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/start_timer_process.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Timer Settings">
    Configure the timer according to your requirements:
    
    1. **Date Specific**: Set a specific date and time for the process to start
    2. **Cycle**: Configure a recurring schedule using cron expressions
    
    <Warning>
      Starting processes through registered timers requires sending a process start message to Kafka, which needs a service account and authentication. See [Service Accounts](../../../setup-guides/access-management/configuring-an-iam-solution#scheduler-service-account) for details.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

For more detailed information about Timer Start Events, refer to the [Start Timer Event](../../building-blocks/node/timer-events/timer-start-event) documentation.

## Message catch start event

Message Catch Start Events allow one process to initiate another through message-based communication, creating dependencies and workflows between processes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure the Sender Process">
    1. Open **FlowX.AI Designer** and create or edit the process that will send the message
    2. Add a **Message Throw Intermediate Event** node at the point where you want to trigger the other process
    3. Configure data that will be used for correlation (e.g., a key value like 'key1')
    
    <Frame caption="Correlation Data Configuration">
      ![Correlation Data Configuration](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/correlation_data.png)
    </Frame>
    
    4. Configure the message correlation in the node properties:
    
    <Frame caption="Message Correlation Configuration">
      ![Message Correlation Configuration](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/message_correlation.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure the Receiver Process">
    1. Create or edit the process that should be started by the message
    2. Add a **Start Message Catch Event** node as the starting point
    3. Configure the node with:
       - The same message name used in the throw event (e.g., 'start_correlation')
       - The correlation key in the Receive data tab (e.g., 'key1')
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test the Configuration">
    Run the sender process and watch as it automatically triggers the receiver process when the Message Throw Event is reached.
    
    <Frame caption="Message Start Event in Action">
      ![Message Start Event in Action](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/start_with_message_event.gif)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Message correlation is essential for message-based communication between processes. It's achieved through the message name (which must be identical in both throw and catch events) and the correlation key (or value).
</Info>
## Best Practices

<Tip>
**When implementing process initiation:**

- **Choose the appropriate method** based on your use case (user-triggered, scheduled, event-based, etc.)
- **Consider authentication requirements** for system-initiated processes
- **Use correlation keys thoughtfully** to ensure reliable message delivery
- **Test your initiation methods** thoroughly in a development environment
- **Monitor process starts** to identify any failures or performance issues
- **Document your initiation methods** for easier maintenance and troubleshooting
</Tip>
