title: Exporting and importing projects
description: Learn how to transfer projects between environments using the export and import functionality in FlowX.AI Designer.
---

Moving projects between environments is a common requirement in enterprise software development. FlowX.AI provides robust export and import functionality to help you promote your projects from development to testing and production environments.

<Info>
In recent versions of FlowX.AI, the export/import functionality has moved from the process definition level to the project level, allowing for more comprehensive and consistent transfers between environments.
</Info>

## Project vs. process export/import

<Card title="Project-Level Operations" icon="folder-tree">
Modern versions of FlowX.AI use **project-level** export and import operations rather than process-level ones. This approach ensures that all related resources, dependencies, and configurations are transferred together, maintaining the integrity of your application.
</Card>

<Note>
This documentation covers the updated project export/import approach. If you're using an older version of FlowX.AI that still handles exports at the process definition level, some details may differ.
</Note>

## Exporting a project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Projects Section">
    1. Open **FlowX.AI Designer** and go to the **Projects** section
    2. Select the project you want to export
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access Export Functionality">
    1. Open the project actions menu (typically a three-dot or "More" icon)
    2. Select the **Export** option

    </Frame>
    
    <Note>
      The screenshot above shows the legacy process export UI. The project export interface may look different but follows similar principles.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Export Options">
    Depending on your version, you may have options to:
    
    1. Export the entire project or specific versions
    2. Include or exclude certain resources
    3. Select dependency handling options
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete the Export">
    1. Click the **Export** button to generate the export package
    2. The system will create a downloadable file containing your project
    3. Save this file to your local system
    
    <Tip>
      Use a clear naming convention for your export files to help identify their contents later, such as `[project-name]_[version]_[environment]_[date].zip`.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Importing a project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Projects Section">
    1. Open **FlowX.AI Designer** in the target environment
    2. Go to the **Projects** section
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access Import Functionality">
    1. Look for an **Import Project** or similar button
    2. Click this button to start the import process
    
    <Frame caption="Import Process Button">
      ![Import Process Button](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/import_proc_version.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select the Import File">
    1. The system will open a file browser dialog
    2. Navigate to and select your previously exported file
    3. Click **Open** or **Select** to proceed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Import Options">
    Before completing the import, the system will display information about what's being imported:
    
    1. Project details and versions
    2. Potential conflicts with existing content
    3. Dependency status
    
    <Warning>
      Pay careful attention to any warnings about version conflicts or missing dependencies, as these might require manual resolution.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm and Complete the Import">
    1. Review all information carefully
    2. Make any necessary adjustments to import options
    3. Click **Import** or **Confirm** to complete the process

## Import scenarios

When importing a project, you may encounter different scenarios depending on whether the project already exists in the target environment and what versions are present.

### New project import

<Card title="New project" icon="plus">
If the project does not exist in the target environment, it will be created with all its resources, and you'll see all versions from the export file.
</Card>

<Frame caption="New project import">

</Frame>

### Existing project with no additional versions

<Card title="Update Existing Project" icon="arrows-rotate">
If the project exists but doesn't have versions beyond those in the import file, the system will update the existing project with any changes from the import file.
</Card>

<Frame caption="Updating Existing Project">

</Frame>

### Existing project with additional versions

<Card title="Version conflict" icon="code-branch">
If the target environment has versions not present in the import file, or if versions have diverged, you'll need to resolve these conflicts during import.
</Card>

<Frame caption="Version Conflict Resolution">

<Warning>
Be cautious when overwriting versions, as this can impact any running processes or deployed applications that use those versions.
</Warning>

## Best practices for export/import

<Tip>
**When transferring projects between environments:**

- **Plan your promotion path** - Establish a clear workflow for moving from development to testing to production
- **Use consistent naming** - Name your projects, versions, and export files consistently across environments
- **Document dependencies** - Keep track of dependencies between projects and libraries
- **Test after import** - Always validate your project in the new environment after import
- **Version control** - Consider using external version control systems in addition to FlowX.AI's built-in versioning
- **Incremental imports** - For large projects, consider importing incrementally rather than all at once
- **Backup before import** - Always back up the target environment before performing significant imports
</Tip>

## Common issues and solutions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Version Compatibility">
    **Issue**: Import fails due to version incompatibility between environments.
    
    **Solution**: Ensure all environments are running compatible versions of FlowX.AI. If necessary, upgrade the older environment before attempting import.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Missing Dependencies">
    **Issue**: Imported project references libraries or resources not present in the target environment.
    
    **Solution**: Export and import dependencies first, or update the project to use dependencies available in the target environment.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Conflict Resolution">
    **Issue**: Conflicts between imported versions and existing versions.
    
    **Solution**: Carefully review the differences and decide whether to overwrite or preserve existing versions. Consider merging changes manually for complex conflicts.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Environment-Specific Configurations">
    **Issue**: Hard-coded environment-specific values in processes or configurations.
    
    **Solution**: Use environment variables and configuration parameters instead of hard-coded values to ease transitions between environments.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
