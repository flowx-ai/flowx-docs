    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define Project Properties">
    Configure the basic properties for your project:

    - **Project Name**: Enter a descriptive name that clearly identifies your business solution
    - **Platform Type**: Select the platform you want to use for your project:
      - Omnichannel
      - Web only
      - Mobile only
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Project Settings">
    Set up additional parameters that define how your project will function:

    - **Default Theme**: Choose a theme to apply a consistent look and feel
    - **Number Formatting**:
      - **Min/Max Decimals**: Configure how numbers are displayed
      - **Date Format**: Choose short or long date formats
      - **Currency Format**: Set display as ISO code (USD) or symbol ($)
    - **Languages**:
      - Set a default language (e.g., English)
      - Add additional languages for localization support

  <Info>
    Project language settings serve two important purposes:
    - They fill the default state for preview in the UI Designer
    - They enable you to create translatable values in enumerations and substitution tags

  </Step>
</Steps>


## Configuring project resources

After creating your project, you'll need to configure various resources before you can build and deploy your application. These resources form the foundation of your solution.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Project Resources">
    Your project includes these key resource sections:
    
    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Processes" icon="diagram-project">
        Define business processes and subprocesses that orchestrate your application workflows
      </Card>

    </Info>
    
    <Tip>
      **Configuration Best Practices**:
      - Begin with process definitions before configuring supporting resources
      - Use clear, consistent naming conventions across all resources
      - Configure reusable components in libraries when they'll be used in multiple projects
      - Test individual components before integrating them into the complete workflow
      - Set up environment variables for settings that differ between environments
      - Create versions after completing significant resource configurations
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Process Definitions">
    Process definitions are the core of your application, defining the user journey and business logic:
    
    - Navigate to the **Processes** section
    - Click **+ New Process** to create a new process
    - Use the BPMN editor to design your process flow
    - Configure actions, forms, and integration points
    
    <Card title="Learn more about Process Definitions" href="../managing-a-project-flow/creating-a-new-process-definition" icon="link" />
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Design User Interfaces">
    Create the screens and components users will interact with:
    
    - Navigate to the **UI Designer** section
    - Create screens for each user-facing step in your processes
    - Configure forms, buttons, and other interactive elements
    - Design responsive layouts for different device types
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Integrations">
    Set up connections to external systems and services:
    
    - Define API endpoints for backend integrations
    - Configure authentication and security settings
    - Create workflows for complex integration scenarios
    - Test connections to ensure proper data exchange
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Configuration Parameters">
    Define environment-specific variables:
    
    - Add parameters that will differ between environments
    - Set default values for development
    - Mask sensitive information like passwords and API keys
    - Organize parameters by functional area

## Project lifecycle management

After configuring your project resources, you'll need to prepare it for deployment through versioning and building:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Project Version">
    When your project configuration reaches a milestone:
  - Create a version to capture the current state
  - You can create multiple versions and commit them before creating a build
  - Versions can be modified until they are committed
  - Committed versions are locked and cannot be changed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Build">
  To deploy your project to an environment:
  - Create a build from any committed version
  - Builds are immutable and serve as deployable packages
  - Each build contains exactly one version of a project
  - Once a build is created, its contents (processes, enumerations, substitution tags, integrations) cannot be edited - you'll need to create a new project version for changes

      ></video>
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deploy Build">
    Deploy your build to the target environment:
    - Development for testing
    - QA for validation
    - Production for end-users
    
    <Info>
      Configuration parameters set for specific environments will be applied during deployment.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best practices

<Warning>
  Projects contain all your process definitions and resources. Use clear naming conventions and proper documentation to maintain organization as your project grows.
</Warning>

- **Project Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names that reflect business purpose
- **Project Scope**: Keep projects focused on specific business domains
- **Documentation**: Add comprehensive descriptions to your project and components
- **Version Control**: Make effective use of the built-in versioning capabilities
- **Configuration Management**: Use environment variables for deployment-specific settings
- **Dependency Management**: Carefully manage library dependencies to avoid conflicts
- **Testing**: Validate changes in development before promoting to production

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I create a new version of a project?">
    To create a new version, navigate to the project dashboard, select "Create New Version," and make any changes. Once finalized, commit the version to lock it.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens when I create a build?">
    Creating a build captures a snapshot of the project version, consolidating resources into a single deployable package. Builds are immutable and cannot be edited once created.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I manage multiple localizations within a project?">
    Yes, projects support multiple locales. You can define regional settings, such as date formats and currencies, to cater to different environments.
    
    <Card title="Learn more about Localization" href="../../building-blocks/ui-designer/localization-and-i18n" icon="page" />
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What is the difference between a Project Version and a Build?">
    A Project Version is a snapshot of resources and configurations that can be modified, tracked, and rolled back. A Build is a deployable package created from a committed version, and it is immutable once deployed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I add a library as a dependency?">
    Go to your project settings, navigate to dependencies, and select the desired library. Choose the build you want to use, and its resources will be accessible within your project.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I make changes to a deployed build?">
    No, a build is immutable. To make changes, modify the project version, create a new version, and deploy a new build.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I ensure that a library update doesn't break my project?">
    Use a controlled environment like Dev or UAT to test new builds of the library before updating the dependency in your main project. This allows you to validate changes and ensure they don't negatively impact your project.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens to resource versions when I update a dependency?">
    When a dependency is updated to a newer build, any resources that were modified in the library will reflect the latest version. Projects have control over when to update, so older versions remain stable until the dependency is manually updated.
