The plugin offers the following features:

* **Document storage and editing**: Easily store and make changes to documents.
* **Document generation**: Generate documents using predefined templates and custom process-related data.
* **WYSIWYG editor**: Create various templates using a user-friendly ["What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) editor](../../wysiwyg).

* **Template import**: Import templates created in other environments.

<Warning>
When exporting a document template, it is transformed into a JSON file that can be imported later.
</Warning>

* **Document conversion**: Convert documents from PDF to JPEG format.
* **Document splitting**: Split bulk documents into smaller separate documents.
* **Document editing**: Add generated barcodes, signatures, and assets to documents.
* **OCR integration**: When a document requires OCR (Optical Character Recognitionq) processing, the Documents Plugin initiates the interaction by passing the document data or reference to the [**OCR plugin**](../ocr-plugin).

The Documents Plugin can be easily deployed on your chosen infrastructure, preloaded with industry-specific document templates using an intuitive WYSIWYG editor, and connected to the FLOWX Engine through Kafka events.

* [**Send Message Task (Kafka)**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#message-send-task)
* [**Receive Message Task(Kafka)**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#message-receive-task)


<Info>
Performance considerations:

To ensure optimal performance while using Documents Plugin, consider the following recommendations:

* For large or complex documents, it is recommended to allocate sufficient system resources, such as CPU and memory, to handle the conversion/editing process efficiently.
* Avoid processing extremely large files or a large number of files simultaneously, as it may impact performance and responsiveness.
* Monitor system resources during the generating/editing/converting etc. process and scale resources as needed to maintain smooth operations.
* Following these performance considerations will help optimize the document processing and improve overall system performance.

## Using Documents plugin

Once you have deployed the Documents Plugin in your infrastructure, you can start creating various document templates. After selecting a document template, proceed to create a process definition by including [**Send Message/Receive Message**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node) (Kafka nodes) and custom document-related actions in your process flow.

Before adding these actions to your **process definition**, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that all custom information is properly configured in the plugin, such as the document templates to be used.
2. For each Kafka send/receive node you will need a corresponding Kafka topic.

<Check>
The `..in` topic names configured for the plugin should match [**the `..out` topic  names used when configuring the engine**](../../../../../setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup#configuring-kafka). Make sure to use an outgoing topic name that matches the pattern configured in the Engine. The value can be found and overwritten in the `KAFKA_TOPIC_PATTERN` variable. 

For more details about Process Engine Kafka topic configuration, click [**here**](../../../../../setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup#configuring-kafka).

To make a request to the plugin, the process definition needs to include an action of type **Kafka send** defined on a [**Send Message Task**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#message-send-task) node. The action parameter should have the key `topicName` and the corresponding topic name as its value.

To receive a reply from the plugin, the process definition needs to include a [**Receive Message Task**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#message-receive-task) node with a node value having the key `topicName` and the topic name as its value.

Once the setup is complete, you can begin adding custom actions to your processes.

Let's explore a few examples that cover both the configuration and integration with the engine for all the use cases supported by the plugin:
