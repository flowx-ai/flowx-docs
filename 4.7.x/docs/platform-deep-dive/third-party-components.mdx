### Third-party open-source components supported/tested versions

<Info>
**FlowX.AI 4.7.x Series Third-Party Support**

The FlowX.AI 4.7.x series provides comprehensive support for third-party dependencies:

- **4.7.0 - 4.7.4**: Standard recommended versions with proven stability
- **4.7.5+**: Extended support ranges introduced, providing greater flexibility in technology stack choices

For optimal performance and reliability, our internal QA process validates new releases using the latest stable versions within each supported range. Legacy versions are supported but may have limited testing coverage.

While exploring alternative versions within the supported ranges, we recommend referring to the compatibility matrix and considering the End-of-Life (EOL) dates for long-term planning.

In the unlikely event that you encounter any compatibility issues with FlowX.AI, please open a support ticket [**here**](https://support.flowx.ai/), and our dedicated team will address and resolve any identified bugs following our standard support process.

### Summary

#### Keycloak

Keycloak is an open-source software product to allow single sign-on with Identity and Access Management aimed at modern applications and services.

**FlowX.AI 4.7.x Support**: Extended support introduced in 4.7.5 - Versions 22 through 26+ with rolling support for future releases. Version 22 is marked as legacy but remains supported. Earlier 4.7.x versions support 22.x and 26.x as recommended versions.

[Keycloak documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/documentation)

#### **Kafka**

Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform that can handle a high volume of data and enables you to pass messages from one end-point to another.

Kafka is a unified platform for handling all the real-time data feeds. Kafka supports low latency message delivery and gives a guarantee for fault tolerance in the presence of machine failures. It has the ability to handle a large number of diverse consumers.

Kafka is very fast and performs 2 million writes/sec. Kafka persists all data to the disk, which essentially means that all the writes go to the page cache of the OS (RAM). This makes it very efficient to transfer data from a page cache to a network socket.

**FlowX.AI 4.7.x Support**: Extended support introduced in 4.7.5 - Versions 3.2 through 3.9. Version 3.2 is marked as legacy but remains supported until 3.9 reaches EOL on February 19, 2027. Earlier 4.7.x versions support 3.2.x as recommended version.

[Kafka documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/)

#### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.

**FlowX.AI 4.7.x Support**: Extended support introduced in 4.7.5 - Versions 16 through 17, providing long-term support with v16 EOL on November 09, 2028 and v17 EOL on November 08, 2029. Earlier 4.7.x versions support 16.2.x as recommended version.

[PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)

#### MongoDB

MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional [schemas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database\_schema).

Used by FlowX to store business process data and configuration information on the core/plugin components.

**FlowX.AI 4.7.x Support**: Extended support introduced in 4.7.5 - Versions 7 through 8, with v7 supported until August 31, 2026 and v8 having no announced EOL date yet. Earlier 4.7.x versions support 7.0.x as recommended version.

[MongoDB documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/)

#### Redis

Redis is a fast, open-source, in-memory key-value data store that is commonly used as a cache to store frequently accessed data in memory so that applications can be responsive to users.

It delivers sub-millisecond response times enabling millions of requests per second for applications.

It is also be used as a Pub/Sub messaging solution, allowing messages to be passed to channels and for all subscribers to that channel to receive that message. This feature enables information to flow quickly through the platform without using up space in the database as messages are not stored.

It is used by FLOWX.AI for caching the process definitions-related data.

**FlowX.AI 4.7.x Support**: Extended support introduced in 4.7.5 - Versions 7.2.x through 8.0. Version 7.2.x is marked as legacy but remains supported. Enhanced support now includes Redis Sentinel mode for High Availability setups starting with 4.7.5. Earlier 4.7.x versions support 7.2.x as recommended version.

#### NGINX

Nginx Is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.

FLOWX utilizes the Nginx engine as a load balancer and for routing the web traffic (API calls) from the SPA (single page application) to the backend service, to the engine, and to various plugins.

The FLOWX.AI Designer SPA will use the backend service to manage the platform via REST calls, will use API calls to manage specific content for the plugins, and will use REST and SSE calls to connect to the engine.

#### EFK (Elastic Search, Fluentd, Kibana)

Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of addressing a growing number of use cases.

As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data for lightning-fast search, fine‑tuned relevancy, and powerful analytics that scale with ease.

Used by FLOWX.AI in the core component and optionally to allow searching for business process transaction data.

**FlowX.AI 4.7.x Support**: Extended support introduced in 4.7.5 - Elasticsearch versions 7 through 9, with v7 supported until January 15, 2026 and v9 having no announced EOL date yet. Earlier 4.7.x versions support 7.17.x as recommended version.

[Elastic stack documentation](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack/)

[Fluentd documentation](https://docs.fluentd.org/)

#### Kafka Connect Elasticsearch Service Sink

The Kafka Connect Elasticsearch Service Sink connector moves data from Apache Kafka® to Elasticsearch. It writes data from a topic in Kafka to an index in Elasticsearch. All data for a topic have the same type in Elasticsearch. This allows an independent evolution of schemas for data from different topics. This simplifies the schema evolution because Elasticsearch has one enforcement on mappings; that is, all fields with the same name in the same index must have the same mapping type.

#### S3 (MinIO)

FLOWX.AI uses [Min.IO](http://min.io/) as a cloud storage solution.

[MIN.IO documentation](https://min.io/)

[Docker available here](https://quay.io/repository/minio/minio?tab=tags&tag=RELEASE.2022-05-26T05-48-41Z)

#### Oracle DB

Oracle Database is a relational database management system (RDBMS).

**FlowX.AI 4.7.x Support**: Extended support introduced in 4.7.5 - Versions 21c through 23ai, with 21c supported until July 31, 2027 and 23ai supported until December 31, 2031. Earlier 4.7.x versions support 21c and 23ai as recommended versions.
