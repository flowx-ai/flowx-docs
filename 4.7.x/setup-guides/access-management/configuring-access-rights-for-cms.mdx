</Info>

In case other custom roles are needed, you can configure them using environment variables. More than one role can be set for each access scope.

To configure access for each of the roles above, adapt the following input:

`SECURITY_ACCESSAUTHORIZATIONS_AUTHORIZATIONNAME_SCOPES_SCOPENAME_ROLESALLOWED: NEEDED_ROLE_NAMES`

Possible values for `AUTHORIZATIONNAME`: `MANAGECONTENTS`, `MANAGETAXONOMIES`.

Possible values for `SCOPENAME`: import, read, edit, admin.

For example, if you need to configure role access for import, insert this:

```
SECURITY_ACCESSAUTHORIZATIONS_MANAGECONTENTS_SCOPES_IMPORT_ROLESALLOWED: ROLE_CMS_CONTENT_IMPORT
```
