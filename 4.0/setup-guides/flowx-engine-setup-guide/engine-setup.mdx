title: FlowX Engine setup
description: This guide will provide instructions on how to set up and configure the FlowX Engine to meet your specific requirements.
---

## Infrastructure prerequisites

The FlowX Engine requires the following components to be set up before it can be started:

* Docker Engine (version 17.06 or higher)
* Kafka (version 2.8 or higher)
* Elasticsearch (version 7.11.0 or higher)
* Database instance


# Dependencies

The FlowX Engine has dependencies on the following components:

* [**Database**](#database---postgres--oracle)
* [**Redis server**](../setup-guides-overview#redis-configuration)
* [**Kafka**](#configuring-kafka)


For Microservices architecture, some Microservices holds their data individually using separate Databases.

A basic Postgres configuration can be set up using a helm values.yaml file as it follows:

*  helm values.yaml:

    ```yaml
      onboardingdb:
        existingSecret: {{secretName}}
        metrics:
          enabled: true
          service:
            annotations:
              prometheus.io/port: {{prometheus port}}
              prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
            type: ClusterIP
          serviceMonitor:
            additionalLabels:
              release: prometheus-operator
            enabled: true
            interval: 30s
            scrapeTimeout: 10s
        persistence:
          enabled: true
          size: 1Gi
        postgresqlDatabase: onboarding
        postgresqlExtendedConf:
          maxConnections: 200
          sharedBuffers: 128MB
        postgresqlUsername: postgres
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 6000m
            memory: 2048Mi
          requests:
            cpu: 200m
            memory: 512Mi
    ```

 
### Redis server

A Redis cluster is required for caching process definitions, compiled scripts, and Kafka responses.

### Kafka cluster

Kafka serves as the backbone of the engine, facilitating communication with external plugins and integrations.

# Configuration

FlowX.AI Engine utilizes environment variables for configuration. Below are the key environment variables you need to configure:

* [**Configuring authorization and access roles**](#authorization--access-roles)
* [**Configuring the data source**](../setup-guides-overview#datasource-configuration)
* [**Configuring Redis**](../setup-guides-overview#redis-configuration)
* [**Configuring logging**](../setup-guides-overview#logging)
* [**Configuring Kafka**](#configuring-kafka)
* [**Configuring access roles for processes**](./configuring-access-roles-for-processes)

## Authorization & access roles

This section outlines the OAuth2 configuration settings for securing the Spring application, including resource server settings, security type, and access authorizations.


### Resource Server Settings (OAuth2 Configuration)

<Warning>
Old configuration from < v4.1 releases (will be deprecated in v4.5):

* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_BASE_SERVER_URL`: The base URL for the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server, which is responsible for authentication and authorization for clients and users, it is used to authorize clients, as well as to issue and validate access tokens.
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID`: A unique identifier for a client application that is registered with the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server, this is used to authenticate the client application when it attempts to access resources on behalf of a user.
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET`: Secret Key that is used to authenticate requests made by an authorization client.
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_REALM`: Security configuration env var in the Spring Security OAuth2 framework, it is used to specify the realm name used when authenticating with OAuth2 providers.
</Warning>

<Info>
New configuration, starting from v4.1 release, available below.

## Configuring Kafka

Kafka handles all communication between the FlowX.AI Engine and external plugins and integrations. It is also used for notifying running process instances when certain events occur. 

### Kafka connection settings

| Environment Variable             | Description                 | Default Value    |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `SPRING_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` | Kafka bootstrap servers     | `localhost:9092` |
| `SPRING_KAFKA_SECURITY_PROTOCOL` | Security protocol for Kafka | `"PLAINTEXT"`    |


### Kafka consumer retry settings

| Environment Variable                  | Description                                                        | Default Value |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| `KAFKA_AUTH_EXCEPTION_RETRY_INTERVAL` | Interval between retries after `AuthorizationException` is thrown. | `10`          |


### Consumer groups & consumer threads configuration

Both a producer and a consumer must be configured:

### Consumer groups & consumer threads

In Kafka a consumer group is a group of consumers that jointly consume and process messages from one or more Kafka topics. Each consumer group has a unique identifier called a group ID, which is used by Kafka to manage message consumption and distribution among the members of the group.

Thread numbers, on the other hand, refer to the number of threads that a consumer application uses to process messages from Kafka. By default, each consumer instance runs in a single thread, which can limit the throughput of message processing. Increasing the number of consumer threads can help to improve the parallelism and efficiency of message consumption, especially when dealing with high message volumes.

Both group IDs and thread numbers can be configured in Kafka to optimize the processing of messages according to specific requirements, such as message volume, message type, and processing latency.

The configuration related to consumers (group ids and thread numbers) can be configured separately for each message type as it follows:

#### Consumer Thread Configuration


| Environment Variable                              | Description                                                            | Default Value |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `KAFKA_CONSUMER_THREADS_NOTIFY_ADVANCE`           | Number of threads for notifying advance actions.                       | `6`           |
| `KAFKA_CONSUMER_THREADS_NOTIFY_PARENT`            | Number of threads for notifying when a subprocess is blocked.          | `6`           |

| `KAFKA_CONSUMER_THREADS_PROCESS_START_FOR_EVENT`  | Number of threads for starting processes for an event.                 | `2`           |
| `KAFKA_CONSUMER_THREADS_PROCESS_EXPIRE`           | Number of threads for expiring processes.                              | `6`           |
| `KAFKA_CONSUMER_THREADS_PROCESS_OPERATIONS`       | Number of threads for processing operations from task management.      | `6`           |
| `KAFKA_CONSUMER_THREADS_PROCESS_BATCH_PROCESSING` | Number of threads for processing bulk operations from task management. | `6`           |

It is important to know that all the events that start with a configured pattern will be consumed by the engine. This makes it possible to create a new integration and connect it to the engine without changing the configuration of the engine.


### Configuring kafka topics

<Tip>
The suggested topic pattern naming convention is the following:

```yaml
 topic:
    naming:
      package: "ai.flowx."
      environment: "dev."
      version: ".v1"
      prefix: ${kafka.topic.naming.package}${kafka.topic.naming.environment}
      suffix: ${kafka.topic.naming.version}
      engineReceivePattern: engine.receive.

    pattern: ${kafka.topic.naming.prefix}${kafka.topic.naming.engineReceivePattern}*
```
</Tip>

<Info>
If you need to send additional keys on the response, attach them in the header, as in the following example, where we used `requestID` key.
</Info>

<Check>
A response should be sent on a `callbackTopic` if it is mentioned in the headers, as in the following example:

![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/bulk_requestid.png)

```json
{"processInstanceId": ${processInstanceId}, "callbackTopic": "test.operations.out", "requestID":"1234567890"}
```
</Check>


<Info>
Task manager operations could be the following: assignment, unassignment, hold, unhold, terminate and it is matched with the `...operations.out` topic on the engine side. For more information check the Task Management plugin documentation:
