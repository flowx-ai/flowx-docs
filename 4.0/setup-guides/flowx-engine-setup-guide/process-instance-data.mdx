## Partitioning

Partitioning involves splitting instance-related tables into multiple tables based on the `creation_time` of each entity. This process is managed by the database, which abstracts access to the partitioned data, so no changes are needed in the application code to locate data in specific partitions.

<Info>
Database Compatibility: Oracle and Postgres.
</Info>

## Detaching

Detaching refers to removing a partition from the working set. For example, if a table is partitioned based on the `creation_date` column, detaching involves removing the oldest partition so it is no longer part of the active dataset. Operations on the table will exclude this detached data.

## Archiving

Archiving is the process of copying detached tables to an external storage solution (such as another database or a data lake) and then removing them from the initial database.

- A cron job in FlowX will manage partitioning based on configured retention intervals.
- Old data and completed instances will be moved to detached and (optionally) compressed tables.

## Daily operations

Once set up, the partitioning and archiving process involves the following operations:

<Steps>
<Step title= "Partition ID Calculation">
The `partition_id` is automatically calculated based on the configured interval (DAY, WEEK, MONTH).
Example for daily partitioning: `2024-03-01 13:00:00` results in `partition_id = 124061`.
</Step>
<Step title="Retention Management">
Data older than the configured retention interval becomes eligible for detachment and compression.
</Step>
<Step title ="Archiving process">
- A cron job checks for eligible partitions.
- Eligible partitions are detached and optionally compressed.
- The process includes deactivating foreign keys, creating new archive tables, moving data references, reactivating foreign keys, and dropping the original partition.
</Step>
<Step title ="Space management">
- Detached tables remain in the database but occupy less space if compression is enabled.
- To free up space, move detached tables to another database or tablespace.
</Step>
</Steps>


## Logging information

Partitioning and archiving actions are logged in two tables:

- `DATA_PARTITIONING_LOG`: For tracking detached partitions.
- `DATA_PARTITIONING_LOG_ENTRY`: For logging SQL commands executed for detachment.

## Technical details

### Partition ID Calculation
    
- The `partition_id` format: `LEVEL || YEAR || BIN_ID_OF_YEAR`. Calculated based on start date of `process_instance`, partition interval, and partition level.
- Example: For a timestamp `2024-03-01 13:00:00` and daily partitioning interval, the `partition_id` is `124061`.

### Detached and Compressed Tables
    
- Naming format: `archived__${table_name}__${interval_name}_${reference}`.
- Example: `archived__process_instance__monthly_2024_03`.

### Configuration example

Check the following section for the environment variables needed to cofigure the data partitioning:

## Enabling Partitioning and ES Kafka Indexing Strategy

When partitioning is enabled, the Elasticsearch (ES) Kafka indexing strategy must also be enabled and configured on FlowX Engine setup.

Configuration Example:

```yaml
flowx:
  indexing:
    enabled: true  # true | false - Specifies if the ElasticSearch indexing for the entire app is enabled or disabled.
    processInstance:  # Configuration set for indexing process instances. Can be duplicated for other objects.
      indexing-type: kafka  # Options: no-indexing | http | kafka - The chosen indexing strategy.
      index-name: process_instance  # The index name that is part of the search pattern.
      shards: 1
      replicas: 1
```


<Card icon="info">
Why?

* When detaching process instances, data from Elasticsearch must also be deleted, not just the cache but also indexed keys (e.g., those indexed for data search on process instances).
</Card>

Check the Elastic search indexing setup here:

[Elasticsearch indexing setup](./configuring-elasticsearch-indexing/)

The partitioning configuration should be aligned with the configuration in the Kafka Elasticsearch connector, especially the following environment variables, so the intervals are similar:

### Index Partitioning:

* `transforms.routeTS.topic.format: "process_instance-${timestamp}"`: This value must start with the index name defined in the process-engine config: flowx.indexing.processInstance.index-name. In this example, the index name is prefixed with "process_instance-" and appended with a timestamp for dynamic index creation. For backward compatibility, the prefix must be "process_instance-". However, backward compatibility is not strictly required here.
yaml

* `transforms.routeTS.timestamp.format: "yyyyMMdd"`:This format ensures that timestamps are consistently represented and easily parsed when creating or searching for indices based on the process instance start date. You can adjust this value as needed (e.g., for monthly indexes, use "yyyyMM"). However, note that changing this format will cause existing indexed objects to remain unchanged, and update messages will be treated as new objects, indexed again in new indices. It is crucial to determine your index size and maintain consistency.
