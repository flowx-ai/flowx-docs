## Configuring an Exclusive Gateway node

<Frame>

</Frame>

To configure this node effectively, it's essential to set up both the **input** and **output** sequences within the gateway process.

![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/gateway_exclusive_diagram.png)

### General configuration

* **Node name**: Give your node a meaningful name.
* **Can go back**: Enabling this option allows users to revisit this step after completing it.

<Info>
When a step has "Can Go Back" set to false, all preceding steps become inaccessible.
</Info>

* [**Swimlane**](../../platform-deep-dive/user-roles-management/swimlanes): Choose a swimlane, ensuring that specific user roles have access only to certain process nodes. If there are no multiple swimlanes, the value is **Default**.

* [**Stage** ](../../platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/task-management/using-stages): Assign a stage to the node.

### Gateway decisions

* **Language**: When configuring conditions, you can use [MVEL](/docs/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-mvel) (or [DMN](#dmn-example)) expressions that evaluate to either **true** or **false**.
* **Conditions**: In the **Gateway Decisions** tab, you can see that the conditions (**if, else if, else**) are already built-in and you can **select** the destination node when the condition is **true**.

<Warning>
The order of expressions matters; the first **true** evaluation stops execution, and the token moves to the selected node.
</Warning>

After the exclusive portion of the process, where one path is chosen over another, you'll need to either end each path (as in the example below) or reunite them into a single process (as in the example above) using a new exclusive gateway without any specific configuration.

## MVEL example

### Getting input from a Switch UI element

Let's consider the following example: we want to create a process that displays 2 screens and one modal. The gateway will direct the token down a path based on whether a switch element (in our case, VAT) is toggled to true or false.

![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/vat_example.png)

If, during the second screen, the VAT switch is toggled on, the token will follow the second path, displaying a modal.

After interacting with the modal, the token will return to the main path, and the process will continue its primary flow.

#### Example configuration

* **Language**: MVEL 
* **Expression**: 

```java
input.application.company.vat == true // you can use the same method to access a value for other supported scripts in our platform: JavaScript, Python and Groovy
```

<Info>
Essentially, you are accessing a specific value or property within a structured data object. The format is usually `input.{{key from where you want to access a value}}`. In simpler terms, it's a way to verify if a particular property within your input data structure (input.application.company.vat key attached to Switch UI element) is set to the value true. If it is, the condition is met and returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
</Info>

![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/config_example_xor.png)

<Info>
The `application.company.vat` key corresponds to the switch UI element.

## DMN example

If you prefer to use [DMN](../../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-dmn) to define your gateway decisions, you can do so using exclusive gateways.

### Getting input from a Switch UI element 

**Gateway Decision - DMN example** [(Applicable only for Exclusive Gateway - XOR)](./exclusive-gateway-node)

![Gateway Decision](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/xor_dmn_decision.png)

#### Configuration example

* **Language**: DMN
* **Expression**: `application.company.vat`

<Info>
In our case, the expression field will be filled in with `application.company.vat` key, which corresponds to the switch UI element.
</Info>

* **Hit Policy**: Unique
* **Type**: Boolean
* **Next Node name**: Enter the name of the nodes to which you prefer the token to be directed.

### Getting input from multiple UI elements 

Consider another scenario in which the process relies on user-provided information, such as age and membership status, to determine eligibility for a discount. This decision-making process utilizes a DMN (Decision Model and Notation) decision table, and depending on the input, it may either conclude or continue with other flows.

#### Configuration example

![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/dmn_multiple_UI_elements.png)

<Info>
In our case, the expressions fields will be populated with the `application.company.vat` and `application.client.membership` keys, which correspond to the user input collected on the initial screen.

The process is visualized as follows:
