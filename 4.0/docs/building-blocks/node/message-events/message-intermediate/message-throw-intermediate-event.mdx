**Why it is important?** The Message Throw Intermediate Event is important because it allows different parts of a process to communicate and share information with each other. 


## Configuring a message throw intermediate event

A Message throw intermediate event is an event in a process where a message is sent to trigger a communication or action with another part of the process (can be correlated with a catch event). It represents the act of throwing a message to initiate a specific task or notification. The event creates a connection between the sending and receiving components, allowing information or instructions to be transmitted. Once the message is thrown, the process continues its flow while expecting a response or further actions from the receiving component.

* **Correlate with catch events** - the dropdown contains all catch messages from the process definitions accessible to the user
* **Correlation key** - is a process key that uniquely identifies the instance to which the message is sent
* **The data field** - allows the user to define a JSON structure with the data to be sent along with the message
