FLOWX platforms support various node types, each requiring distinct configurations to fulfill its role in the business flow. A BPMN node serves as a visual element that represents a specific point or action in your process workflow.

## Types of BPMN Nodes and Their Functions

Here's a comprehensive overview of all BPMN node types available in FlowX:

+ **Start and End Nodes** - Essential elements that mark the initiation and conclusion of a [process flow](../../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-bpmn). A [process definition](../process/process-definition) can contain multiple:
  + Start nodes (each with specific start conditions)
  + End nodes (based on different flow outcomes)

+ **Message-Related Nodes**:
  + **Send Message Tasks** - Handle outbound communication with external systems, integrations, and plugins
  + **Receive Message Tasks** - Manage incoming communications from external systems
  + **Message Events** - Capture and manage interactions between different process participants through message references

+ **Task Nodes** - Process elements added when a [business rule](../actions/business-rule-action/business-rule-action) needs to execute during a process flow

+ **User Task Nodes** - Specialized nodes that:
  + Configure UI appearance and behavior
  + Handle data transmission to custom components
  + Manage user interactions and input

+ **Gateway Nodes**:
  + **Exclusive Gateways** - Decision points that determine which process branch to follow based on conditions
  + **Parallel Gateways** - Control points that split the process flow into two or more simultaneous [branches](../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/adding-more-flow-branches)

+ **Subprocess Nodes**:
    + **Call Activity** - Advanced node type for initiating and managing subprocesses
    + **Start Embedded Subprocess** - Specialized node for initiating and managing subprocesses within a parent process, enabling modular process design
