description: "A BPMN node is a visual representation of a point in your **process**. Nodes are added at specific process points to denote the entrance or transition of a record within the process."

FLOWX platforms support various node types, each requiring distinct configurations to fulfill its role in the business flow.

## Types of BPMN nodes

Let's explore the key types of BPMN nodes available in FlowX:

+ **Start and End nodes** - Mark the initiation and conclusion of a [process flow](../../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-bpmn). A [process definition](../process/process-definition) may have multiple start nodes (each linked with a start condition) and end nodes based on the flow outcomes.
+ **Send Message and Receive Message tasks** - Used for communication with external systems, integrations, and plugins.
+ **Message Events** - Capture interactions between different process participants by referencing messages.
+ **Task** nodes - Added when a [business rule](../actions/business-rule-action/business-rule-action) needs to execute during a process flow.
+ **User Task** nodes - Configure the appearance and behavior of the UI and send data to custom components.
+ **Exclusive Gateways** - Mark decision points in the process flow, determining the branch to be followed.
+ **Parallel Gateways** - Split the process flow into two or more [branches](../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/adding-more-flow-branches) occurring simultaneously.

* **Subprocess Run Node** - A node providing advanced options for starting subprocesses.

After gaining a comprehensive overview of each node, you can experiment with them to create a process. More details are available in the following section:
