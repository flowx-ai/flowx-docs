title: Timer expressions
---

When working with FLOWX.AI components, there are multiple scenarios in which timer expressions are needed.

There are two timer expressions formats supported:

* [**Cron expressions**](#cron-expressions) - used to define the expiry date on processes
* [**ISO 8601**](#iso-8601) - used to define the duration of a response timeout or for a timer expression

### Cron expressions

A cron expression is a string made up of **six mandatory subexpressions (fields) that each specifies an aspect of the schedule** (for example, `* * * * * *`). These fields, separated by white space, can contain any of the allowed values with various combinations of the allowed characters for that field.

<Info>
A field may be an asterisk (`*`), which always stands for “first-last”. For the day-of-the-month or day-of-the-week fields, a question mark (`?`) may be used instead of an asterisk.
</Info>

<Warning>
Important: Only Spring cron expressions are permissible for configuration. Refer to the [**official documentation**](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/support/CronExpression.html) for detailed information on configuring Spring Cron expressions.
</Warning>

Subexpressions:

1. Seconds
2. Minutes
3. Hours
4. Day-of-Month
5. Month
6. Day-of-Week
7. Year (optional field)

An example of a complete cron-expression is the string `0 0 12 ? * FRI` - which means **every Friday at 12:00:00 PM**.

[Scheduling cron expressions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/integration.html#scheduling-cron-expression)

#### Cron Expressions are used in the following example:

* [**Process definition**](../../../building-blocks/process/process-definition) - **Expiry time** - a user can set up a `expiryTime` function on a process, for example, a delay of 30s will be set up like:

### ISO 8601

ISO 8601 is an international standard covering the worldwide exchange and communication of date and time-related data. It can be used to standardize the following: dates, time of delay, time intervals, recurring time intervals, etc.

More details:

[ISO 8601 date format](https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001488-13/reference/r_iso_8601_date_format.htm)

[ISO 8601 duration format](https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs//90001488-13/reference/r_iso_8601_duration_format.htm)

#### ISO 8601 format is used in the following examples:

* **Node config** - **Response Timeout** - can be triggered if, for example, a topic that you define and add in the **Data stream topics** tab does not respect the pattern

ISO 8601 dates and times:

| Format accepted      | Value ranges                                 |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Year (Y)             | YYYY, four-digit, abbreviatted to two-digit  |
| Month (M)            | MM, 01 to 12                                 |
| Week (W)             | WW, 01 to 53                                 |
| Day (D)              | D, day of the week, 1 to 7                   |
| Hour (h)             | hh, 00 to 23, 24:00:00 as the end time       |
| Minute (m)           | mm, 00 to 59                                 |
| Second (s)           | ss, 00 to 59                                 |
| Decimal fraction (f) | Fractions of seconds, any degree of accuracy |

* [**Actions**](../../actions/actions) - **Timer expression** - it can be used if a delay is required on that action
