A Timer Boundary Event is a crucial timing mechanism in Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) that allows you to add time-based triggers to tasks or subprocesses. These events trigger based on a specified duration or at a specific date/time while the associated task or subprocess is running.

Timer Boundary Events solve common business process challenges such as:
- Setting deadlines for task completion
- Creating time-based notifications or reminders
- Implementing timeout handling
- Managing parallel time-sensitive activities
- Scheduling recurring process actions

## Timer Boundary Event - Interrupting

An Interrupting Timer Boundary Event attaches to a specific activity (task or subprocess) and triggers when a defined time condition is met. When triggered, it interrupts and terminates the current activity, redirecting the process flow.

### Configuration

Configure Interrupting Timer Boundary Events with these parameters:

| Field      | Validations | Accepted Values                  |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| Definition | Mandatory   | ISO 8601 formats (date/duration) |
|            |             | Process param                    |

### General Rules

* The system creates a scheduler when a token enters the parent activity
* The scheduler waits for the timer event trigger
* Upon trigger, the ongoing activity terminates and the process follows the defined transition

## Timer Boundary Event - Non-Interrupting

A Non-Interrupting Timer Boundary Event also attaches to activities but operates differently. When triggered, it creates a parallel process path while allowing the original activity to continue running.

### Configuration

Configure Non-Interrupting Timer Boundary Events with these parameters:

| Field      | Validations | Accepted Values                  |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| Definition | Mandatory   | ISO 8601 formats (date/duration) |
|            |             | Process param                    |

### General Rules

* When a token reaches a node with a Non-Interrupting Timer Boundary Event:
    * The system schedules a trigger without affecting the current token execution
* A scheduler is created when the token enters the parent activity
* For cycle timers, the system reschedules for the specified number of repetitions
* The scheduler cancels automatically if the token exits the activity before triggering
