# Subprocess Management

Subprocesses (also known as child processes) are smaller process flows triggered by actions in the main process. They can inherit some process parameter values from the parent process and communicate with front-end apps using the same connection details as their parent process.

## Overview

Subprocesses can be started in two modes:

* **Asynchronous**: Execute alongside the parent process without delaying it (parallel execution)
* **Synchronous**: The parent process waits until subprocesses are finished before advancing (sequential execution)

## Configuring & Starting Subprocesses

There are three primary methods to design and implement subprocesses within the FlowX Designer:

<Steps>
<Step title ="Start Subprocess Action">
*  Implement within user tasks or task nodes
*  Ideal for triggering child processes from task-based activities
</Step>
<Step title="Call Activity Node">
*  Custom node type in the main process
*  Useful for modular process design and reusability
</Step>
<Step title ="Start Embedded Subprocess Node">
*  Using the corresponding node
*  Best for contained, closely-coupled subprocess operations
</Step>
</Steps>

### Parameter Inheritance

<Info>
Parameter inheritance functionality is available for **Start Subprocess** action and **Call Activity** node.
</Info>

By default, subprocesses inherit all parent process parameter values. You can configure inheritance using two methods:

* **Copy from Current State**: Select specific keys to copy from parent to subprocess
* **Exclude from Current State**: Specify keys to exclude from inheritance

Sub-processes can also have an [**Append Params to Parent Process**](../actions/append-params-to-parent-process) action configured inside their process definitions which will append their results to the parent process parameter values.

## Executing Subprocesses

Define subprocess execution mode through the `startedAsync` parameter:

* **Asynchronous**: Set `startedAsync: true` for parallel execution
* **Synchronous**: Set `startedAsync: false` for sequential execution

In synchronous mode, subprocesses notify completion to the parent process. The parent process then resumes its flow and handles subprocess data.
