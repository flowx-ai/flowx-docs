Subprocesses are smaller process flows triggered by actions in the main process. They can inherit some process parameter values from the parent process and communicate with front-end apps using the same connection details as their parent process.


## Overview

Subprocesses can be started in two modes:

* **Asynchronous**: Execute alongside the parent process without delaying it.
* **Synchronous**: The parent process waits until subprocesses are finished before advancing.

## Configuring & starting subprocesses

Design subprocesses within the FlowX Designer, mirroring the main process structure.

### Parameter inheritance

Available for **Start Subprocess** action and **Call Activity** node.

By default, subprocesses inherit all parent process parameter values. Configure inheritance by:

* **Copy from Current State**: Select keys to copy.
* **Exclude from Current State**: Specify keys to ignore.

Sub-processes can also have an [**Append Params to Parent Process**](../actions/append-params-to-parent-process) action  configured inside their process definitions which will append their results to the parent process parameter values.

## Executing subprocesses

Define subprocess execution mode:

* **Asynchronous/Synchronous**: Set the `startedAsync` parameter accordingly.

In synchronous mode, subprocesses notify completion to the parent process. The parent process then resumes its flow and handles subprocess data.
