## Interacting with areas

Once you've added a new navigation area, you can interact with it through the breadcrumbs menu, which provides the following options:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title ="Area settings">

Use **Area Settings** to configure the following properties:

* **Name** - a name for the navigation area element that is visible in the **Navigation menu**

<Info>
This does not represent the label for your navigation area (for example, for a step element) that would be visible in the process at runtime. To set the label for your element, use the UI Designer to edit it.
To do that, trigger the **Navigation View** menu, then navigate to your element and click on the breadcrumbs. Afterward, click "UI Designer."

### Stepper

A stepper breaks down progress into logical and numbered steps, making navigation intuitive.

</Frame>

You can also define a stepper in step structure with the possibility to track progress and also returning to a previously visited step (as you can see in the navigation areas in the example above).

#### Steps

Steps are individual elements within a stepper, simplifying complex processes.

### Tab bar

#### Tabs

### Page

Use this UI configuration to display comprehensive full-page content.

### Modal

Modals provide temporary control over user interaction within a process, often as pop-ups or overlays, guiding users through a specific task before returning to the main application or website functionality.

### Zone

Acts as a container meant to control UI navigation, grouping certain elements. The best use case in which can be used is a process with a header and footer.

### Parent Process  Area

## Navigation per platform
