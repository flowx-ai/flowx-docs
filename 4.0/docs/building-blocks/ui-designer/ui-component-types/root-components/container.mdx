The following properties can be configured in the container:

## Properties and settings

### Settings (Generic)

#### When used as root

When employed as the root component, the container offers the following settings:

* **Custom UI Payload**: A valid JSON describing the data sent to the frontend when the process reaches a specific user task. 
* **Expressions (Hide condition)**: JavaScript expressions utilized to dynamically hide components based on conditions.

#### When not used as root

When the container is not used as the root, you can configure only the **Hide Condition** property.

* **Layout** - this property is available for components that group children and includes the following options:
    * **Position**:
        * **Static**: This style remains fixed and does not scroll along with the page content.
        * **Sticky**: When the sticky property is enabled, the container maintains its position even during scrolling.
            * **Layout**: You have the option to specify minimum distances between the container and its parent element while scrolling. At runtime, sticky containers will keep their position on scroll relative to top/ bottom/ right/ left margin of the parent element
    * Direction - Horizontal / Vertical (for example, select *Horizontal*)
    * Justify (H) - (for example, select *end*)
    * Align (V) - this option allows you to align components vertically
