# Understanding Root Components

Root components are fundamental building blocks that define the layout and hierarchy of elements within an application. These base-level components serve as containers and organizational elements for your user interface design.

## Available Root Component Types

### Container Component

The Container component serves as a foundational wrapper element used to group and configure the layout for multiple components of any type. It provides a flexible structure for organizing content and creating responsive layouts within your UI.

Learn more about [Container components](./container).

### Custom Component

Custom components are specialized Angular components that are developed within the container application and dynamically passed to the SDK at runtime. These components, identified by unique names, enable developers to extend and customize UI functionality according to specific needs.

Explore [Custom components](./custom) for advanced customization options.

### Card Component

The Card component shares functionality with Container components while offering additional features such as accordion behavior, providing enhanced flexibility in UI design and content organization.

Discover more about [Card components](./card).

## Component Hierarchy Structure

Cards and containers can maintain a hierarchical component structure as shown in this example:

1. [**Form**](../form-elements/) - Groups and aligns form field elements (inputs, radios, checkboxes, etc.)
