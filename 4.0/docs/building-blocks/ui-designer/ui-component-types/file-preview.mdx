The settings for the File Preview element include the following properties:

* **Title**: Specifies the title of the element. If the file is downloaded or shared, the file name should serve as the title used in the preview component.
* **Subtitle**: Allows for the inclusion of a subtitle for the element.
* **Display mode**: Depending on the selected display method, the following properties are available:
    * **Inline** → **Has accordion**:  
        * `false`: Displays the preview inline without an expand/collapse option.
        * `true` (Default View: Collapsed): Displays the preview inline with an expand/collapse option, initially collapsed.
        * `true` (Default View: Expanded): Displays the preview inline with an expand/collapse option, initially expanded.

    * **Modal** → view icon is enabled 
* **Has accordion**:  Introduces a Bootstrap accordion, facilitating the organization of content within collapsible items. It ensures that only one collapsed item is displayed at a time.
* **Source Type**: 
    * **Media Library**: Refers to PDF documents uploaded in the Media Library.
    * **Process Data**: Identifies the key location within the process where the document is sourced, establishing the linkage between the document and process data.
    * **Static**: Denotes the document's URL, serving as a fixed reference point.

<Warning>
It's worth noting that the inline modal view can raise accessibility issues if the file preview's height exceeds the screen height.
