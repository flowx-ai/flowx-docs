title: Select
description: The Select form field is an element that enables users to make a choice from a list of predefined options. It consists of multiple values, each of which is defined by a label that is displayed in the dropdown menu, and a code that is saved.

<Info>
For instance, you could have a label of "Female" with the value "F" and "Male" with the value "M". This means that when a user selects "Female" in the process instance, the value "F" will be stored for the "Select" key.

## Configuring the Select element

### Generic settings


These allow you to customize the generic settings for the Select element:

* [**General**](#general)
* [**Properties**](#properties)
* [**Datasource**](#datasource)
* [**Validators**](#validators)
* [**Expressions**](#expressions)
* [**UI actions**](#ui-actions)
* [**Select styling**](#select-styling)

#### General
   
* **Process data key** - creates the binding between form element and process data so it can be later used in [decisions](../../../node/exclusive-gateway-node), [business rules](../../../actions/business-rule-action/business-rule-action) or [integrations](../../../node/message-send-received-task-node#from-integration)

#### Properties
   
* **Label** - the label of the select
* **Placeholder** - placeholder when the field has no value
* **Empty message** - text displayed for custom type when no results are found
* **Search for options** - displays a search to filter options
* **Has clear** - to clear the content of the field
* **Helpertext** - additional information about the select field (can be hidden inside an infopoint)

#### Data source configuration

* **Default value** - autofill the select with this value. Going back to the example with Woman label with F value and Man with M to have a default value of Woman we need to configure here F
* **Source Type** - it can be Static, Enumeration, or Process Data
    * **Static** -  static data
        * **Add option** - label - value pairs can be defined here
    * **Process Data** - data sourced directly from your process definition
   
<Tip>
Consider this scenario: you need to create two dynamic select fields where the options in the second field depend on the selection made in the first. By utilizing the **Parent** property within the **Process Data** configuration of the second select field, you can achieve this dynamic functionality.

</Tip>


#### Validators

There are multiple validators can be added to a select (more details [here](../../validators)).

#### Expressions
   
The select field's behavior can be defined using JavaScript expressions for hiding or disabling the element. The following properties can be configured for expressions:
   
* **Hide** - JavaScript expression used to hide the Select Field when it returns a truthy value
* **Disabled** - JavaScript expression used to disable the Select Field when it returns a truthy value

<Info>
It's important to make sure that disabled fields have the same expression configured under the path expressions â†’ hide.

</Frame>

#### UI actions

UI actions can be added to the select element to define its behavior and interactions. 

* **Event** - possible value: `CHANGE`
* **Action Type** - select the action type

<Info>
For more details on how to configure a UI action, click [**here**](../../ui-actions).
</Info>

### Select styling

Styling the Select field using CSS properties allows you to customize the appearance of the dropdown list and make it more visually appealing and consistent with the overall design of the website or application. 

<Card title="UI Designer styling" href="../../ui-designer#styling">
</Card>

For example, a FORM element with a [layout](../../ui-designer#layout) configuration including direction of Horizontal and some inputs, and a select element will look like this:

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/ui-designer/select_form_field1.png)
</Frame>

#### Icons

When customizing the appearance of a Select UI element that includes a left icon, you can utilize the following properties:

* **Icon Key** - the key associated in the Media library, select the icon from the **Media Library**

<Info>
When setting the color, the entire icon is filled with that color, the SVG's fill. Avoid changing colors for multicolor icons.
</Info>

#### Sizing

When adjusting the Fit W, you can control the width of the select element:

* **Fit W**: fill, fixed or auto

#### Spacing

Margin and padding are CSS properties used to create space between elements in a web page:

- **margin** - the space outside a select element
- **padding** - the space inside a select element

## Example - dynamic dropdowns

As mentioned previously, you can create dropdowns including static data, enumerations, or **process data**. Let's create an example using **process data** to create a process that contains **dynamic dropdowns**.

To create this kind of process, we need the following elements:

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/d_dropdowns.gif)
</Frame>

* a [**task node**](../../../node/task-node) (this will be used to set which data will be displayed on the dropdowns - by adding a business rule on the node)

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/d_dropdowns1.gif)
</Frame>

* a [**user task node**](../../../node/user-task-node) (here we have the client forms and here we add the SELECT elements)

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/d_dropwdowns2.gif)
</Frame>

### Creating the process

Follow the next steps to create the process from scratch:

1. Open **FlowX Designer** and from the **Processes** tab select **Definitions**.
2. Click on the breadcrumbs (top-right corner) then click **New process** (the Process Designer will now open).
3. Now add all the **necessary nodes** (as mentioned above).

### Configuring the nodes

1. On the **task node**, add a new **Action** (this will set the data for the dropdowns) with the following properties:
   * Action type - **Business Rule**
   * **Automatic**
   * **Mandatory**
   * **Language** (we used an [**MVEL**](../../../../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-mvel) script to create a list of objects)

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/d_business_rukle.png)
</Frame>

Below you can find the MVEL script used in the above example:

```java
output.put("application",
{
    "client": {
        "identity": [
        {
            "value": "001",
            "label": "Eddard Stark"
        },
        {
            "value": "002",
            "label": "Sansa Stark"
        },
        {
            "value": "003",
            "label": "Catelyn Stark"
        }
    ]},
    "contracts": {
        "001": [
            {
                "value": "c001",
                "label": "Eddard Contract 1"
            },
            {
                "value": "c007",
                "label": "Eddard Contract 2"
            }
        ],
        "003": [
            {
                "value": "c002",
                "label": "Catelyn Contract 1",
            },
            {
                "value": "c003",
                "label": "Catelyn Contract 2 ",
            },
            {
                "value": "c004",
                "label": "Catelyn Contract 3"
            }
        ],
        "002": [
            {
                "value": "c005",
                "label": "Sansa Contract 1",
            }
        ]
    }
});
```

2. On the **user task node**, add a new **Action** (submit action, this will validate the forms and save the date) with the following properties:

* **Action type** - Save Data
* **Manual**
* **Mandatory**
* **Data to send** (the key on which we added client details and contracts as objects in the business rule) - `application`

</Frame>

### Configuring the UI

Follow the next steps to configure the UI needed:

1. Select the **user task node** and click the **brush icon** to open [**UI Designer**](../../ui-designer).
2. Add a [**Card**](../root-components/card) UI element as a [**root component**](../root-components/) (this will group the other elements inside it) with the following properties:
* Generic:
   * **Custom UI payload** - `{"application": ${application}}` - so the frontend will know which data to display dynamically when selecting values from the **SELECT** element
   * **Title** - _Customer Contract_
3. Inside the **card**, add a [**form element**](./).
4. Inside the **form** add two **select elements**, first will represent, for example, the _Customer Name_ and the second the _Contract ID._
5. For first select element (Customer Name) set the following properties:
   * **Process data key** - `application.client.selectedClient`
   * **Label** - Customer Name
   * **Placeholder** - Customer Name
   * **Source type** - Process Data (to extract the data added in the **task node**)
   * **Name** - `application.client.identity`

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/select_customer.png)
</Frame>


6. For the second select element (Contract ID) set the following properties:
   * **Process data key** - `application.client.selectedContract`
   * **Label** - Contract ID
   * **Placeholder** - Contract ID
   * **Source Type** - Process Data
   * **Name** - `application.contracts`
   * **Parent** - `SELECT` (choose from the dropdown list)

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/select_contract.png)
</Frame>

7. Add a button under the form that contains the select elements with the following properties:
   * **Label** - Submit
   * **Add UI action** - add the submit action attached earlier to the user task node

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/submit_b.png)
</Frame>

8. Test and run the process by clicking **Start process**.
