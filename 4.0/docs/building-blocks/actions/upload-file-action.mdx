**What is Upload File Action?** An Upload File action is a specialized action type that enables file uploads to services available on Kafka within your FlowX implementation.

**Why is it useful?** The action facilitates file transfer from the frontend to Kafka while automatically handling metadata attachment, making it ideal for document management and file processing workflows.

## Configuring an Upload File Action

Configure Upload File actions through the **FlowX Designer** using the **Actions** tab at the [task node level](../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/adding-an-action-to-a-node). The configuration includes these main sections:

* [Action Edit Settings](#action-edit)
* [Back in Steps Configuration](#back-in-steps)
* [Parameter Settings](#parameters)
* [Data Transfer Configuration](#data-to-send)

### Action Edit

Configure the basic action properties:

* **Name** - Unique identifier for the action within the process (follow your naming conventions for better maintainability)
* **Order** - Execution sequence when multiple actions exist on the same node
* **Timer expression** - Optional delay setting using [ISO 8601 duration format](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) (e.g., `PT30S` for 30 seconds)
* **Action type** - Select **Upload File**
* **Trigger type** - Choose between:
  * Automatic - Executes when process reaches the step
  * Manual - Requires user intervention
* **Required type** - Set as Mandatory/Optional (Note: Automatic actions must be Mandatory)
* **Repeatable** - Enable multiple triggers of the same action
* **Autorun Children** - Automatically execute child actions after parent completion

### Back in Steps

Configure process navigation options:

* **Allow BACK on this action** - Enables the [back-in-process functionality](../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/moving-a-token-backwards-in-a-process) for redoing previous actions

### Parameters

Essential upload configuration settings:

* **Address** - Target Kafka topic for file upload
* **Document Type** - Metadata classification (used by [document plugin](../../platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/documents-plugin/documents-plugin-overview))
* **Folder** - File identification path/value
* **Advanced configuration (Show headers)** - JSON configuration for Kafka message headers

### Data to Send

<Warning>
Only available for actions with **Manual** trigger type.
</Warning>

* **Keys** - Data validation parameters for frontend submissions (See [User Task configuration](../node/user-task-node) for details)

## Implementation Example

Here's a practical example using the Upload File Action with the [document plugin](../../platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/documents-plugin/documents-plugin-overview):

**Parameters Configuration:**

* **Address (topicName)**: `ai.flowx.in.document.persist.v1` (document plugin service ID)
* **Document Type**: `BULK` (document plugin metadata)
* **Folder**: `${application.client.id}` (uses client ID from process instance data)

**Advanced Configuration:**

* **Headers**: `{"processInstanceId": ${processInstanceId}, "destinationId": "currentNodeName"}`
