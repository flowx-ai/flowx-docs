## Creating a DMN Business Rule action

To create and link a DMN <Tooltip tip ="Business rules are actions that can be configured on task/user task nodes in a business process. Business rules can be written in various script languages such as MVEL, JavaScript, Python, Groovy, or DMN (Decision Model and Notation).">**business rule** </Tooltip> action to a task **node** in FLOWX, follow these steps:

<Steps>
1. Launch <Tooltip tip ="The Designer is the FLOWX.AI no-code visual development environment. It allows users to create web and mobile applications without having to know how to code."> **FlowX Designer** </Tooltip> and navigate to <Tooltip tip ="The core of the platform is the process definition, which is the blueprint of the business process made up of nodes that are linked by sequences."> **Process Definitions** </Tooltip>.
2. Locate and select your specific process from the list, then click on **Edit Process**.
3. Choose a **task node**, and click the **Edit** button (represented by a key icon). This action will open the node configuration menu.
4. Inside the node configuration menu, head to the **Actions** tab and click the "**+**" button to add a new action.
5. From the dropdown menu, select the action type as **Business Rule**.
6. In the **Language** dropdown menu, pick **DMN**.
</Steps>

For a visual guide, refer to the following recording:

## Using a DMN Business Rule Action

Consider a scenario where a bank needs to perform client information tasks/actions to send salutations, similar to what was previously created using MVEL [here](./business-rule-action#business-rules-examples). 

A business person or specialist can use DMN to design this business rule, without having to delve into technical definitions.

Here is an example of an **MVEL** script defined as a business rule action inside a **Service Task** node:

```java
if (input.application.client.gender == 'F') {
    output.put("application", {
        "client": {
            "salutation": "Ms"
        }
    });
} else if (input.application.client.gender == 'M') {
    output.put("application", {
        "client": {
            "salutation": "Mr"
        }
    });
} else {
    output.put("application", {
        "client": {
            "salutation": "Mx"
        }
    });
}
```

The previous example can be easily transformed into a DMN Business Rule action represented by the decision table:

In the example above, we used FEEL expression language to write the rules that should be met for the output to occur. FEEL defines a syntax for expressing conditions that input data should be evaluated against.

**Input** - In the example above, we used the user-selected gender from the first screen as input, bound to the `application.client.gender` key.

**Output** - In the example above, we used the salutation (bound to `application.client.salutation`) computed based on the user's gender selection.

DMN also defines an XML schema that allows DMN models to be used across multiple DMN authoring platforms. The following output is the XML source of the decision table example from the previous section:
