title: Listing stored files
description: If you are using an S3-compatible cloud storage solution such as [MinIO](https://min.io/), the stored files are organized into buckets. A bucket serves as a container for objects stored in Amazon S3. The Documents Plugin provides a REST API that allows you to easily view the files stored in the buckets.
---

To determine the partitioning strategy used for storing generated documents, you can access the following key in the configuration:

`application.file-storage.partition-strategy`

```yaml
application:
  defaultLocale: en
  supportedLocales: en, ro
  jaeger.prefix: document
  #fileStorageType is the configuration that activates one FileContentService implementation. Valid values: minio / fileSystem
  file-storage:
    type: s3
    disk-directory: MS_SVC_DOCUMENT
    partition-strategy: NONE

```

The `partition-strategy` property can have two possible values:

* **NONE**: In this case, documents are saved in separate buckets for each process instance, following the previous method.
**PROCESS_DATE**: Documents are saved in a single bucket with a subfolder structure based on the process date. For example: `bucket/2022/2022-07-04/process-id-xxxx/customer-id/file.pdf`.


## REST API

The Documents Plugin provides the following REST API endpoints for interacting with the stored files:


### List buckets

<Check>
  Check out the [**List buckets API reference**](/4.0/docs/api/list-buckets) for more details.
</Check>

* This endpoint returns a list of available buckets.

### List objects in a bucket

<Check>
  Check out the [**List objects in a bucket API reference**](/4.0/docs/api/list-objects-in-buckets) for more details.
</Check>

* This endpoint retrieves a list of objects stored within a specific bucket. Replace `BUCKET_NAME` with the actual name of the desired bucket

### Download file

<Check>
  Check out the [**Download file API reference**](/4.0/docs/api/download-file.mdx) for more details.
</Check>

* This endpoint allows you to download a file by specifying its path or key.
