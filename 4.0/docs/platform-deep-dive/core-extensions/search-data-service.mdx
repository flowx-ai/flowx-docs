title: FlowX.AI Data Search
description: The Data Search service is a microservice that enables data searches within other processes. It facilitates the creation of processes capable of conducting searches and retrieving data by utilizing Kafka actions in tandem with Elasticsearch mechanisms.
---

<Tip>
Data Search service leverages Elasticsearch to execute searches based on indexed keys, using existing mechanisms.
</Tip>

## Using the Data Search service

### Use case

- Search for data within other processes
- Display results indicating where the search key was found in other processes
- Filter search results based on process status, date ranges, and specific process definitions
- Perform complex data queries across multiple process instances

### Search Capabilities

The Data Search service supports the following search features:

* **Exact Match Search**: Find precise matches for specific values
* **Date Range Filtering**: Filter results based on process start dates
* **Process Status Filtering**: Filter by process states (STARTED, FINISHED, ONHOLD, etc.)
* **Multi-Process Search**: Search across multiple process definitions simultaneously
* **Result Limiting**: Automatically limits large result sets (maximum 50 results)

For our example, two process definitions are necessary:

- one process used to search data in another process - in our example ***"search_process_CDN"***

</Frame>

- one process where we look for data - in our example ***"add_new_clients"***

## Add data process example

Firstly, create a process where data will be added. Subsequently, the second process will be used to search for data in this initial process.

</Frame>

<Warning>
In the "Add Data Process Example" it's crucial to note that we add mock data here to simulate existing data within real processes.
</Warning>

Example of MVEL Business Rule:

```json
output.put ("application", {
  "date": "22.08.2022",
    "client": {
      "identificationData": {
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe",
        "cityOfBirth": "Anytown",
        "primaryDocument": {
          "number": 123456,
          "series": "AB",
          "issuedCountry": "USA",
          "issuedBy": "Local Authority",
          "issuedAt": "01.01.2010",
          "type": "ID",
          "expiresAt": "01.01.2030"
        },
        "countryOfBirth": "USA",
        "personalIdentificationNumber": "1234567890",
        "countyOfBirth": "Any County",
        "isResident": true,
        "residenceAddress": {
          "country": "USA",
          "city": "Anytown",
          "street": "Main Street",
          "streetNumber": 123
        },
        "mailingAddress": {
          "country": "USA",
          "city": "Anytown",
          "street": "Main Street",
          "streetNumber": 123
        },
        "pseudonym": null
      },
    }
    }
);
```

Now we can play with this process and create some process instances with different states.

## Search process example

Configure the "Search process" to search data in the first created process instances:

<Steps>
<Step title ="Create process">
Create a process using the [**Process Designer**](../../building-blocks/process/process).
</Step>
<Step title ="Displaying the results (optional)">
Add a [**Task node**](../../building-blocks/node/task-node) within the process. Configure this node and add a business rule if you want to customize the display of results, e.g:

```java
output.put("searchResult", {"result": []});
output.put("resultsNumber", 0);
```

<Tip>
For displaying results in the UI, you can also consider utilizing [**Collections**](../../building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/collection/) UI element to show search results in a paginated table format.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title ="Configure the search node">
Add a **user task** and configure a send event using a [**Kafka send action**](../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#send-message-task). Configure the following parameters:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title ="Topic name">
The Kafka topic for the search service requests (defined at `KAFKA_TOPIC_DATA_SEARCH_IN` environment variable in your deployment).

![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/search_in_topic.png)

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Body message">

```json
{
	"searchKey": "application.client.identificationData.lastName",
	"value": "12344",
	"processStartDateAfter": "YYY-MM-DD:THH:MM:SS", //optional, standard ISO 8601 date format
	"processStartDateBefore": "YYY-MM-DD:THH:MM:SS", //optional, standard ISO 8601 date format
	"processDefinitionNames": [ "processDef1", "processDef2"],
	"states": ["STARTED", "FINISHED", "ONHOLD"] //optional, depending if you want to filter process instances based on their status
}
```

* **searchKey** - represents the process key used to search data stored in a process. This should match the exact path to the data you want to search for.

<Warning>
Indexing this key within the process is crucial for the Data Search service to effectively locate it. To enable indexing, navigate to your desired process definition and access **Process Settings → Task Management → Search indexing**.

![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/indexed_key.png)

❗️ Keys are indexed automatically when the process status changes (e.g., created, started, finished, failed, terminated, expired), when swimlanes are altered, or when stages are modified. To ensure immediate indexing, select the 'Update in Task Management' option either in the **node configuration** or within **Process Settings → General** tab.
</Warning>

* **value** - the search term to look for in the specified searchKey
* **processStartDateAfter/Before** - optional date filters in ISO 8601 format
* **processDefinitionNames** - array of process definition names to search within
* **states** - optional array of process states to filter by (e.g., "STARTED", "FINISHED", "ONHOLD")

<Info>
Check the Understanding the [Process Status Data](../../building-blocks/process/process-instance) section for more examples of possible states.
</Info>

<Frame>

</Frame>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Data to send">
- **Data to send (key)**: Used for validating data sent from the frontend via an action (refer to **User Task** configuration section) 
</Accordion>
<Accordion title ="Advanced configuration (Headers)">
- **Headers**: Mandatory - `{"processInstanceId": ${processInstanceId}}`

<Check>
If you also use callbackActions, you will need to also add the following headers:
`{"destinationId": "search_node", "callbacksForAction": "search_for_client"}`
</Check>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

</Info>
</Step>
<Step title ="Performing the search">
A custom microservice (a core extension) will receive this event and search the value in Elasticsearch.
</Step>
<Step title ="Receiving the response">
It will respond to the engine via a Kafka topic (defined at `KAFKA_TOPIC_DATA_SEARCH_OUT` env variable in your deployment). Add the topic in the **Node config** of the User task where you previously added the Kafka Send Action.

### Search Response Format

The service returns responses in the following formats:

####  If there is no result:

```json
{
	"result": [],
	"searchKey": "application.client.name.identificationData.lastName",
	"tooManyResults": false,
	"searchValue": "random"
}
```
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/noResults.png)
</Frame>

<Tip>
To access the view of your process variables, tokens and subprocesses go to **FLOWX.AI Designer > Active process > Process Instances**. Here you will find the response.
</Tip>

####  If there are results:

```json
{
	"searchKey": "application.client.identificationData.personalIdentificationNumber",
	"result":[{
			"processInstanceUUID": "UUID",
			"status": "FINISHED",
			"processStartDate": date,
			"data": {"all data in elastic for that process"}
	}],
	"tooManyResults": true|false
}
```

<Info>
**NOTE**: 
- The service returns up to 50 results maximum
- When `tooManyResults` is true, it indicates there are more matching results available
- The `data` field contains all indexed information for the matching process
</Info>

</Frame>

### Best Practices for Search Implementation

1. **Index Planning**: Carefully plan which fields need to be searchable and index only necessary data
2. **Performance Optimization**: Use date filters and process status filters to narrow down search scope
3. **Error Handling**: Always check for the `tooManyResults` flag and implement appropriate UI feedback
4. **User Experience**: Implement proper loading states and error messages in the UI
5. **Security**: Ensure proper access controls are in place for searchable data

#### Developer Setup

<Warning>
Enabling Elasticsearch indexing **requires** activating the configuration in the **FlowX Engine**. Check the [**indexing section**](../../../setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/configuring-elasticsearch-indexing/) for more details.
