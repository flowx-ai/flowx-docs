title: Theming migration guide
description: Imagine your project involves an omnichannel application spanning multiple countries, each with its own branding and guidelines. Each platform also presents its unique challenges. How do you ensure a consistent user experience across branches and platforms?
version: v4.x
---

**Solution**: Theming streamlines the design process by establishing a consistent visual language across platforms. It simplifies development by allowing you to set a base theme and then override specific elements based on platform requirements, saving time and effort.

## How to work with themes 



<Steps>
<Step title="Creating the theme">
Before creating the theme, upload your company's font files in the **Content Management** section in **Designer**.

</Frame>

<Card title = "Font management" href="../font-files">
</Card>

Then, navigate to Themes and click "Create New Theme." In the modal, add the theme's name, select the font family, primary color, and create.

## Overrides

* **Before launching Theming feature**: you'd configure styles for each component in **UI Designer** or adjust JSON files for design/. 
* **With Theming**: use Theme Overrides in UI Designer to adjust styles for specific UI elements based on the platform.


## Changelog

<Tip>
This changelog encompasses the changes that were brought together with the Themes feature to the UI components in **4.0** release.

### Root components

* **Card Element**: Previously (in **v3.x.x**) could have set a **Card style** property: **border** or be **raised**.

Now, for processes migrated from **v3.x.x** to acheive the previous styling (with "raised prop" or "border") you should adjust shadows and borders using **Theme Overrides** for **Card** element in **UI Designer**:
