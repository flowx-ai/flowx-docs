title: Theming migration guide
description: If the project involves an omnichannel application spanning multiple countries with diverse branding and guidelines, it's crucial to simplify and streamline the process to ensure a consistent user experience across branches and all platforms (Web and Mobile).
---

**Solution**: Theming streamlines the design process by establishing a consistent visual language across platforms. It simplifies development by allowing you to set a base theme and then override specific elements based on platform requirements, saving time and effort.

## How to work with themes 

<Steps>
<Step title="Creating the theme">
Before creating the theme, upload the font files associated with your company's visual identity in the Content Management section of the FlowX Designer.

<Card title = "Font management" href="../font-files">
</Card>

Then, navigate to Themes and click "Create New Theme." In the modal, add the theme's name, select the font family, primary color, and create.

<Accordion title ="Design Tokens" icon ="pen-ruler">
* **Design Tokens**: Represent the single source of truth for the theme, storing visual elements of the design system.
* **Color Palette, Shadows, Typography Tokens**: Configure these tokens based on your company's brand guidelines. They ensure reusability and consistency.

<Step title= "Add the Theme to the Container App">
Copy the UUID of your theme and add it to the container app.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Overrides

With the Overrides feature you have now the possibility to override default theme settings on specific elements or sections.

Use Theme Overrides in UI Designer to adjust styles or props for specific UI elements based on the desired platform (Web, iOS and Android).

<Info>
All components can now be styled with token overrides, for color, typography and shadow settings defined in the theme.
</Info>

<Info>
**Theme overrides** in **UI Designer** are applied to the component itself, rather than to specific themes. This means that when switching the view to another theme, the overrides persist and apply to the new theme as well.
</Info>



## Important details

<Info>
There are some changes that were brought together with the Theme Management feature to the UI components in **4.0** release that might impact your previous UI configuration.
</Info>

### Universal Styling

Introduced the option for platform-specific customization for components across Web, iOS, and Android.

### Layout

In the context of the Theme Management feature, you can now apply the previously configured paddings directly from the previosuly used theme JSONs within the theme settings. Review the paddings you had set up previously and apply them in the Themes section.

**Themes → Global Settings → Styles**

#### Components spacing

If you set it in **Theme → Global Settings**, it will cascade to all the following components:

* Input/ Selection 
* Buttons
* Radio/Checkbox
* Message
* Segmentted Button
* Stepper
* Tabs

</Frame>

<Tip>
If you want to override the padding set in **Global Settings** for the above components, navigate to **Components → Your Component** and set your desired padding.
</Tip>

<Info>
After editing the padding for a component, you can also reset the values and they will be set back to the values you added in **Global settings**.
</Info>

#### Layout elements

To set the padding for layout elements( **Cards** and **Forms**), access:

**Themes → Components → Layout Elements**

#### Tabs

To set the padding for Tabs you can do by accessing:

**Themes → Components → Tabs**

### Root components

* **Card Element**: Previously (in **v3.x.x**) could have set a **Card style** property: **border** or be **raised**. 

|                                              Card 4.0                                              |                                              Card 3.0                                              |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| <Frame>![Card 4.0](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/card4.0.png)</Frame> | <Frame>![Card 3.0](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/card3.0.png)</Frame> |
|                                                                                                    |                                                                                                    |


Now, for processes migrated from **v3.x.x** to acheive the previous styling (with "raised prop" or "border") you can either set up from Themes or by using **Theme Overrides** for **Card** element in **UI Designer**:

<Tip>
Depending on the number of Card elements present in your migrated processes, it's essential to devise a strategic approach. If a significant portion of the cards feature "border" styling, you can configure this setting within Themes Management and will be cascading through all of them. For the remaining cards, manual intervention is required to apply the "raised" effect by **overriding** their styles using **Theme Overrides**.
</Tip>

</Frame>


### Buttons

All **primary** and **secondary** buttons, in 4.x they transformed to **fill** buttons. If there were secondary buttons, once moved to "fill", they will appear similar to primary ones. You should perform an override in the UI Designer to make them look like secondary buttons as they did initially.

<Frame>

</Frame>


| Version | Primary | Secondary | Ghost | Text | Fill | New States: Pressed, Hover, Disabled |
| ------- | :-----: | :-------: | :---: | :--: | :--: | :----------------------------------: |
| 3.x.x   |   ✓    |    ✓     |  ✓   |  ✓  |      |                                      |
| 4.x.x   |         |           |  ✓   |  ✓  |  ✓  |                  ✓                  |


By following this migration guide, you can seamlessly transition to the Theming 4.0 feature, enhancing your project's design process and ensuring consistency across platforms and branches.


### Icons - No color property

<Info>
Now, all icon color settings have a "No Color" option, which allows the icon (SVG) to be rendered with its original color settings.
</Info>

If you are utilizing SVG icons for UI components (such as a left icon on an input element) and you desire to ensure that the color remains consistent regardless of the theme settings, it is imperative to override all states associated with the "Left icon," as demonstrated in the example below:
