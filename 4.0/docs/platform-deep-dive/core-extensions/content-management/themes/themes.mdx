## Configuring a new theme

After creating a theme, you must configure it. To configure your theme effectively, follow these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title ="Access theme settings">
- Navigate to the settings or customization section of your application (in the UI Designer).
- Look for options related to styling and think of an overall design
</Step>
<Step title ="Choose a theme">
- Select a pre-existing theme from the available options if provided.
- Alternatively, start with a default theme and customize it according to your preferences.


</Step>
<Step title ="Customize theme settings">

<Info>
The Themes styles mechanism is based on hierarchy. In this hierarchy we have the following elements: Design Tokens, Global Settings and Components.
</Info>

Modify color schemes (using the design tokens), typography, spacing, and other visual elements to match your desired look and feel.
Use the provided tools or controls to adjust theme settings. This might include sliders, color pickers, or dropdown menus.


<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title ="Design Tokens" icon ="pen-ruler">

<Info>
**The Design Tokens** represent values based on which the theme is built.
</Info>

* **Color Palette, Shadows, Typography Tokens**: Configure these tokens based on your company's brand guidelines. They ensure reusability and consistency.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title= "Global Settings" icon ="gears">

<Info>
The **Global Settings** are properties that inherit values from the **Design Tokens** and sit on the top of the hierarchy. These properties are then inherited by the **Components**.
</Info>


* **Platform-specific Settings**: Configure settings for each platform (web, iOS, Android) based on the global settings you've defined.
* **Styles and Utilities**: General settings applying to all components (styles) and labels, errors, and helper text settings (utilities).

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Component-level configuration" icon="hammer">

<Info>
From the shadows onwards, you have to configure the settings for each platform: web, iOS and Android. It’s important to pay attention to this, because if you configure the web theme, for example, it won’t be automatically inherited by iOS or Android. 
</Info>

<Tip>
For example, you can configure a web theme, and then leverage the push and import options. You can push from the web the same configuration to iOS or Android.
</Tip>

**Component-level Configuration**: Customize the style of each component type.

<Info>
Keep in mind, there are differences between platforms, for example, for button configuration there are different properties available. What you configure on a platform will not be inherited by the others.
</Info>

</Step>
<Step title= "Reviewing the changes (multi-platform)">
- Before finalizing the theme configuration, it's crucial to review how the changes will appear across different platforms. This step ensures consistency and allows for platform-specific adjustments if needed.
- You can do that by either using the preview feature from **Themes** or by using the preview mode in the **UI Designer** by switching to your preffered platform.

</Step>

## Managing themes - process level (theme overrides)

With Themes feature in UI Designer you can add theme properties overrides available for each platform and element.

### Styles tab

Styles tab serves three platforms: Web, iOS and Android.

Here you can configure the styles for each compoent for each platform which apply the theme styles configured in your theme.

If you want to override the theme settings for an element, you will need to add a theme override.

Overrides are completely independent of the theme, regardless of which theme you choose in the preview mode.
</Info>

## Using a Theme in the Container Application

To integrate the theme into your container application, follow these steps:

- Copy the unique identifier (UUID) associated with the theme.
- Set the copied UUID within your container application.
- By doing so, ensure that the renderers within your application can recognize and apply the specified theme effectively.
