## Configuring a new theme

To configure your theme effectively, follow these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title ="Access theme settings">
- Navigate to the settings or customization section of your application (in the UI Designer).
- Look for options related to styling and think of an overall design
</Step>
<Step title ="Choose a theme">
- Select a pre-existing theme from the available options if provided.
- Alternatively, start with a default theme and customize it according to your preferences.


</Step>
<Step title ="Customize theme settings">
Modify color schemes (using the design tokens), typography, spacing, and other visual elements to match your desired look and feel.
Use the provided tools or controls to adjust theme settings. This might include sliders, color pickers, or dropdown menus.

<Info>
From the shadows onwards, you have to configure the settings for each platform: web, iOS and Android. It’s important to pay attention to this, because if you configure the web theme, for example, it won’t be automatically inherited by iOS or Android. 
</Info>


- For example, you can configure a web theme, and then leverage the push and import options. You can push from the web the same configuration to iOS or Android.
