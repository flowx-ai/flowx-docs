# Business Filters for Access Control

Business filters provide a powerful way to restrict access to [**process instances**](../../building-blocks/process/process-instance) based on specific business attributes. This feature ensures that only authorized users with matching attributes can access and interact with specific process instances.

## Overview

Business filters are commonly used to implement data segregation and access control based on organizational structures, such as:
- Bank branch locations
- Department divisions
- Geographic regions
- Business units
- Customer segments

## How Business Filters Work

1. **Configuration**: Business filter attributes must be configured in the identity management platform as a list of filters.
2. **Authorization**: These filters are made available through the authorization token.
3. **User Assignment**: Application users are assigned specific filter values matching their business context.
4. **Process Implementation**: The process definition includes nodes with actions that store the current business filter value using the custom `task.businessFilters` key in process parameters.

## Access Control Enforcement

When business filters are set in the process instance parameters, the system automatically enforces access control:
- Only users with matching business filter attributes can view and interact with the process instance
- Users without matching attributes will not have access to the process instance
- This filtering happens automatically at the platform level

## Integration with Business Rules

Business filters can be combined with [**business rules**](../../building-blocks/actions/business-rule-action/business-rule-action) to create sophisticated access control patterns. For example:
- Restricting process access to specific branch users
- Limiting visibility of customer data to regional teams
- Enforcing departmental boundaries in multi-step processes

## Example Implementation

```javascript
// Example of setting a business filter in a process action
{
  "task.businessFilters": {
    "branchId": "BRANCH-001",
    "region": "NORTH"
  }
}
```

By implementing business filters, organizations can ensure secure and controlled access to their process instances while maintaining proper data segregation based on business requirements.</fileContent>
