description: To copy **process definitions** and move them between different environments, you can use the export/import feature.

## Export a process definition

You can export a process definition as a JSON file directly from the process definitions list in the **FlowX Designer**:

## Import a process definition

You can then import the process definition from the FLOWX Designer. This will add a new definition to your database and set it as a draft. You can then check the imported definition and publish the process to be able to use it from the **engine**.

In case a definition with the same name and version already exists in the environment, the version of the imported process will be incremented.

<Warning>
In case the process definition was exported using an incompatible FLOWX Designer version, you will receive an error and not be able to import it. It will first need to be adjusted to match the format needed by your current FLOWX Designer version.
