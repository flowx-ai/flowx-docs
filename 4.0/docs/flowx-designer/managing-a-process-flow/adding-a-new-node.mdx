<br></br>
A BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) node is a visual representation of a point in your process. Nodes are added at specific process points to denote the entrance or transition of a record within the process. FlowX supports various node types, each requiring distinct configurations to fulfill its role in the business flow.

Depending on the type of the **node**, you can define:
* Node details and properties
* Set values (stages, data stream topics, key name)
* Add various [actions](../../building-blocks/actions/actions) to customize node behavior
