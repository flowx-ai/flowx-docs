To split the <Tooltip tip= "A process is a representation of a business use case, such as requesting a new credit card. These steps can involve a combination of automated actions and human interactions."> Process flow </Tooltip> into more steps, you just need to use a parallel gateway node type.

### Steps for creating a flow with two branches

To create a flow with two branches:

<Steps>
<Step>
Open **FlowX Designer** and go to the **Definitions** tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Click on the **New process** button, using the **breadcrumbs** from the top-right corner.
</Step>
<Step>
Add a **start node** and a **parallel gateway node**.
</Step>
<Step>
Create two parallel zones by adding different nodes and link the zones after the **parallel gateway node**.
</Step>
<Step>
Add another **parallel gateway** to merge the two flow branches back into one branch.
</Step>
<Step>
 Add an **end node**.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
When  working with parallel gateways, tokens play a critical role in ensuring that the process flow is managed correctly. Here's an overview of token behavior in parallel gateways:
<Steps>
<Step>
When a process reaches a parallel gateway, the gateway creates child tokens for each branch in the parallel paths. Each path operates independently.
</Step>
<Step>
Each child token advances through its respective path independently, proceeding from one node to the next based on the sequence and actions defined in the process.
</Step>
<Step>
A closing parallel gateway node is used to merge parallel paths back into a single flow. The parent token waits at this closing gateway until all child tokens have completed their respective paths.
</Step>
</Steps>
