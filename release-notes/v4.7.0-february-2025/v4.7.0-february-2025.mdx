## Projects

### Copy resources across projects

Moving resources between projects is now **fast and seamless**. The new **Copy to Another Project** feature ensures all dependencies stay intact, eliminating the hassle of manual adjustments.

></video>
</Frame>

<Tabs>  
<Tab title="How it works">  
1️⃣ **Select a destination** – Choose the target project or library.  
2️⃣ **Pick a branch (if applicable)** – For WIP versions, select the target branch.  
3️⃣ **Review dependencies** – The system displays referenced resources and validates dependencies.  
4️⃣ **Resolve identifier conflicts** – If an identifier already exists in the destination, you'll be prompted to either: 
    - **Keep both** (create a duplicate) 
    - **Replace** (overwrite the existing resource) 
    - **Use destination** (retain the existing resource without copying)
</Tab>  
<Tab title="Why it’s better">  
- **No broken references** – Everything stays connected.  
- **Auto-add missing dependencies** – No manual setup required.  
- **Works with WIP & committed versions (only from committed to WIP)** – Flexibility for your workflow.  
</Tab>

### Duplicate resources

<Tabs>  
<Tab title="What you can duplicate">  
The **Duplicate Resource** feature lets users create a copy of an existing resource within the same project or library version, streamlining workflows and ensuring quick reusability.  

<Frame>
<video
  controls
  className="w-full aspect-video"
  src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/duplicate_resources.mp4"
></video>
</Frame>

You can duplicate the following resources:

- **Processes**  
- **Enumerations**  
- **Media files (including Global media library files)**  
- **Notification templates**  
- **Document templates**  
- **Views**  
</Tab>  

<Tab title="How it works">  
- **Duplicate options** are available from each resource’s three-dot menu (table row & secondary navigation).  
- When selected, a **"Duplicate" modal** opens with a prefilled name: _Copy of [Resource Name]_ (which can be edited).  
- **Cancel** to discard changes or **Duplicate** to create an exact copy in the same project/library version.  
- **Success confirmation:** The system navigates to the newly created resource and displays a success message.  
- **Error handling:** If a resource with the same name/key exists, users will be prompted to rename it before proceeding.  
</Tab>  

<Tab title="Why it’s useful">  
💡 **Use cases:**  
- Quickly iterate on existing resources.  
- Reduce redundant manual setup.  
- Maintain consistency within projects.  
- Easily clone complex configurations for testing and modifications.

### Track where your resources are used

Monitoring your resources has never been simpler and more efficient. Stay on top of where and how they’re being used.

<CardGroup columns="3">
  <Card title="Process Usage" icon="chart-simple" href="#">  
  Track where a process is referenced, with a clear **Usage Overview modal** that dynamically updates when references change.

### Configuration parameter overrides

🔹 **Libraries can now define configuration parameters** to help test processes or workflows that use those parameters.  

🔹 However, **libraries do not support overrides**.  
- **Overrides for library config parameters must be done within a project** where the library is added as a dependency.  
- **Overrides cannot be added in libraries directly.**  

💡 **What this means:**  
- Libraries provide **default values** for configuration parameters.  
- Projects using those libraries **can override these values** as needed.  
- This ensures **clear separation between library defaults and project-specific configurations** while maintaining flexibility.  

<Tip>
✨ **Overrides take precedence** over library values—so you stay in control.  
</Tip>

### Merge conflict enhancements

Merge conflicts are never fun, but at least now they’re **easier to handle**.

  <Card title="Better Conflict Detection" icon="exclamation">  
  🚨 Prevents merging if identical resource identifiers exist in both branches (e.g., same name, key, or code).

## SDK changes

### Expose Enumerations API in Angular SDK 

Developers can now dynamically retrieve enumerations via the Angular SDK, making it easier to use enums in custom components like dropdowns.
 
<Tip>
How it Works?

A new method in the Angular SDK allows direct access to enumerations, reducing manual imports and improving flexibility.  
</Tip>

<Accordion title="Example usage">

* **Method details**:

```typescript
getEnumerations(enumName: string): { [key: string]: any }
```

* enumName (string) – The name of the enumeration to retrieve.
* Returns: An object containing key-value pairs of the requested enumeration.


Here's how you can use this method to populate a dropdown:

```typescript
export class CustomDropdownComponent {
enums: { [key: string]: any } = {};
constructor(private enumService: EnumerationService) {}

ngOnInit() {
  this.enums = this.enumService.getEnumerations('UserRoles');
}}
```

</Accordion>

## **Bug fixes** 🐞  

✔️ Improved **merge conflict detection and resolution**  
✔️ Fixed **UI rendering issues**  

---

## Changes

### Export/import compatibility

In version 4.7, the import-export functionality for application-version is no longer backward compatible.

* Zip files exported from version 4.7 cannot be imported into earlier FlowX versions.
* Similarly, zip files from earlier versions cannot be imported into 4.7.

<Info>
Zip files for builds and specific resources remain unaffected.
</Info>


## **Known issues** 😅  

We’re aware of a few quirks and are actively working on fixes.  

<AccordionGroup>  

<Accordion title="Processes">  
- 🛠️ **Orphaned sequences** may appear after merging if nodes are deleted but sequences are left behind.  
- 🛠️ **Navigation hierarchy issues** can cause some navigation areas to be hidden.  
- 🛠️ **Undetected conflicts** when a user task is deleted in one branch but modified in another.  
</Accordion>  

<Accordion title="Enumerations">  
- 🛠️ **Duplicate enumeration values** can appear due to missing conflict validation.  
- 🛠️ **Some content values may disappear** after merging.  
</Accordion>  

<Accordion title="Media Library">  
- 🛠️ **Merging branches with media assets may fail**, triggering a 500 error.  
</Accordion>  

<Accordion title="UI/UX">  
- 🛠️ **Merged version is not auto-selected** in the versioning modal.  
- 🛠️ **Merge conflict tree may show numbers instead of names**.  
- 🛠️ **Unnecessary scrollbars** appear in the merge modal.  
</Accordion>
