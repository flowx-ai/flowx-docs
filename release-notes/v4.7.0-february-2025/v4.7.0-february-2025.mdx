## Projects

### **Copy resources across projects**  

Moving resources between projects is now **fast and seamless**. The new **Copy to Another Project** feature ensures all dependencies stay intact, eliminating the hassle of manual adjustments.  

<Tabs>  
<Tab title="How it works">  
1️⃣ **Select a destination** – Choose the target project or library.  
2️⃣ **Pick a branch (if applicable)** – For WIP versions, select the target branch.  
3️⃣ **Review dependencies** – The system displays referenced resources and validates dependencies.  
</Tab>  
<Tab title="Why it’s better">  
- **No broken references** – Everything stays connected.  
- **Auto-add missing dependencies** – No manual setup required.  
- **Works with WIP & committed versions** – Flexibility for your workflow.  
</Tab>  
</Tabs>

### **Track where your resources are used**  

Keeping tabs on your resources just got **a whole lot easier**.  

<CardGroup columns="3">
  <Card title="Process Usage" icon="chart-simple" href="#">  
  Track where a process is referenced, with a clear **Usage Overview modal** that dynamically updates when references change.
  </Card>  

  <Card title="Enumeration Usage" icon="list" href="#">  
  See where enumerations are used across **UI, Data Models, Systems, and Workflows** before making changes.  
  </Card>  

  <Card title="Media Library Usage" icon="image" href="#">  
  Identify **which UI elements reference media assets** so you don’t accidentally break designs.  
  </Card>  
</CardGroup>  

📌 **Before deleting a resource, a confirmation modal lists all affected references. No more surprises!**  

---

### **Configuration parameter overrides**  

No more fighting with rigid library settings! You can now **override configuration parameters** from dependencies directly within your project.  

<Tip>
✨ **Overrides take precedence** over library values—so you stay in control.  
</Tip>

- **New "Configuration Parameters Overrides" section** in **Runtime settings**  
- **Search-enabled dropdown** dynamically suggests parameters from:  
  - Your **current project**  
  - **All libraries** in the **Active Policy**  
- If multiple libraries define the same parameter, the list shows **all values in parentheses**  
---

### **Merge conflict enhancements**  

Merge conflicts are never fun, but at least now they’re **easier to handle**.  

<CardGroup columns="3">
  <Card title="Better Conflict Detection" icon="exclamation">  
  🚨 Prevents merging if identical resource identifiers exist in both branches (e.g., same name, key, or code).  
  </Card>  
  <Card title="Resizable Merge Conflict Tree" icon="maximize">  
  🖥️ Resize the merge conflict tree for better visibility and navigation.  
  </Card> 
  <Card title="New Conflict Type" icon="code-branch">
📢 A new conflict detection system for parent changes/deletions in both branches is under review.
</Card>   
</CardGroup>

## **Bug fixes** 🐞  

✔️ Improved **merge conflict detection and resolution**  
✔️ Fixed **UI rendering issues**

## **Known issues** 😅  

We’re aware of a few quirks and are actively working on fixes.  

<AccordionGroup>  

<Accordion title="Processes">  
- 🛠️ **Orphaned sequences** may appear after merging if nodes are deleted but sequences are left behind.  
- 🛠️ **Navigation hierarchy issues** can cause some navigation areas to be hidden.  
- 🛠️ **Undetected conflicts** when a user task is deleted in one branch but modified in another.  
</Accordion>  

<Accordion title="Enumerations">  
- 🛠️ **Duplicate enumeration values** can appear due to missing conflict validation.  
- 🛠️ **Some content values may disappear** after merging.  
</Accordion>  

<Accordion title="Conflict Detection Gaps">  
- 🛠️ **Adding values to a deleted data model key does not raise a conflict**, causing silent data loss.  
</Accordion>  

<Accordion title="Media Library">  
- 🛠️ **Merging branches with media assets may fail**, triggering a 500 error.  
</Accordion>  

<Accordion title="UI/UX">  
- 🛠️ **Merged version is not auto-selected** in the versioning modal.  
- 🛠️ **Merge conflict tree may show numbers instead of names**.  
- 🛠️ **Unnecessary scrollbars** appear in the merge modal.  
</Accordion>
