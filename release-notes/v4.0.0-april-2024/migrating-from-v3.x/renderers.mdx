### Removal of theming v1 old configurations

<Warning>
Breaking change: All old configs linked with old theming configuration (< 4.0 releases) must be removed from your SDK deployment:
</Warning>


#### 3.4.x
```yaml
...
themePaths: {
    components: 'assets/theme/theme_components.json',
    tokens: 'assets/theme/theme_tokens.json',
...
},
```

### Authorization token

* **AuthToken Management**: The ui-sdk no longer relies on the authToken being stored in LOCAL_STORAGE. Instead, the 'access_token' is now passed as an input to the `<flx-process-renderer>` component through a private variable.

<Warning>
**Breaking Change:** This update is mandatory for proper functionality of SSE (Server-Sent Events).
</Warning>

<Info>
By adopting this approach, clients gain the flexibility to implement the most secure token management strategy tailored to their specific security needs. Moreover, shifting the responsibility to the container application for updating the 'access_token' input ensures that any changes or refreshes to the authToken are securely managed within the application's domain. This proactive approach effectively mitigates potential security vulnerabilities associated with token management, offering a robust and adaptable solution.

## Android SDK 

### Authentication changes

The authentication mechanism has changed, so, instead of passing the `String` value for the access token, a `FlowxSdkApi.Companion.AccessTokenProvider` must be used instead.<br/>

This provider is defined as a functional interface returning the actual value of the access token:
```kotlin
fun interface AccessTokenProvider {
    fun get(): String
}
```

Related changes:

1. The provider can be passed, if the business logic allows it, when calling the `FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().init(...)`.

As a consequence, the new signature for the `FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().init(...)` is:
```kotlin
fun init(
    context: Context,
    config: SdkConfig,
    accessTokenProvider: AccessTokenProvider? = null,
    customComponentsProvider: CustomComponentsProvider? = null,
)
```

2. The `FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().startProcess(...)` `accessToken` parameter was dropped. It is not needed anymore, as from now on, the authentication will rely solely on the `AccessTokenProvider`.

The new signature of this method is:
```kotlin
fun startProcess(
    processName: String,
    params: JSONObject = JSONObject(),
    isModal: Boolean = false,
    closeModalFunc: ((processName: String) -> Unit)? = null,
): @Composable () -> Unit
```

3. The `FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().continueProcess(...)` `accessToken` parameter was dropped. It is not needed anymore, as from now on, the authentication will rely solely on the `AccessTokenProvider`.

The new signature of this method is:
```kotlin
fun continueProcess(
    processUuid: String,
    isModal: Boolean = false,
    closeModalFunc: ((processName: String) -> Unit)? = null,
): @Composable () -> Unit
```

4. The calls of the `FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().updateAccessToken("some_access_token")` method must be replaced by calls of the `FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().setAccessTokenProvider(accessTokenProvider = { "some_access_token" })`.

<Tip>Whenever the access token changes based on your own authentication logic, it must be updated in the renderer by calling the `setAccessTokenProvider` method again.</Tip>

[Learn more](../sdks/android-renderer#authentication) about the authentication mechanism.

### Theming changes

The theming mechanism was replaced by a new approach, which enforces loading a theme before starting or resuming a process.

Related changes:

1. The `ai.flowx.android.sdk.process.model.SdkConfig` theming related parameters (i.e. `themeTokensJsonFileAssetsPath` and `themeComponentsJsonFileAssetsPath`) were dropped.

Because of that, when configuring the library through the `FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().init(...)` method, the `config` parameter will look like this:
```kotlin
FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().init(
    ...
    config = SdkConfig(
        baseUrl = "URL to FlowX backend",
        imageBaseUrl = "URL to FlowX CMS Media Library",
        language = "en",
        validators = mapOf("exact_25_in_length" to { it.length == 25 }),
    ),
    ...
)
```

2. For styling the UI components displayed when rendering a process, while authenticated, the `FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().setupTheme(...)` method must be called before starting or resuming any process:
```kotlin
suspend fun setupTheme(
    themeUuid: String,
    fallbackThemeJsonFileAssetsPath: String? = null,
    @MainThread onCompletion: () -> Unit
)
```
This will fetch a priorly defined theme in the FlowX Designer, cache it and then load its properties.<br/>
A process should be started or resumed only after the `onCompletion` closure is called, signaling the completion of setting up the theme.

[Learn more](../sdks/android-renderer#theming) about the theming mechanics.

### Custom components changes

1. All `import ai.flowx.android.sdk.component.*` directives must be changed to `import ai.flowx.android.sdk.ui.components.*`

2. The type of the `data` parameter passed to a custom component through the `populateUi(data: JSONObject)` method, both for `@Composable` and for classical `View` system approaches, changed to `Any?`.<br/><br/>
Therefore, the new signature of the method is `populateUi(data: Any?)`.<br/><br/>
As a consequence, type checking, casting and extracting the needed data must be part of the implementation details of the custom component.

<Tip>
    The value for the `data` parameter received in the `populateUi(data: Any?)` could be:<br/>
    - `Boolean`
    - `String`
    - `java.lang.Number`
    - `org.json.JSONObject`
    - `org.json.JSONArray`
</Tip>
