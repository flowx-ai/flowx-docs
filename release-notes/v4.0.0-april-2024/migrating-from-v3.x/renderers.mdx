## Web SDK

### Removal of legacy Theming v1 configurations

<Warning>
Breaking change: All old configs linked with old theming configuration (< 4.0 releases) must be removed from your SDK deployment:
</Warning>

1. Review Usage: Identify where you have applied theming v1 configurations in your project.

#### 3.4.x example:
```yaml
...
themePaths: {
    components: 'assets/theme/theme_components.json',
    tokens: 'assets/theme/theme_tokens.json',
...
},
```

2. Update to Theming 4.0: Update your theming configurations to use the latest theming v2 approach. Refer to our documentation or migration resources for guidance on transitioning to the new theming system.



### Authorization token

* **AuthToken Management**: The ui-sdk no longer relies on the authToken being stored in LOCAL_STORAGE. Instead, the 'access_token' is now passed as an input to the `<flx-process-renderer>` component through a private variable.

<Warning>
**Breaking Change:** This update is mandatory for proper functionality of SSE (Server-Sent Events).
</Warning>

<Info>
By adopting this approach, clients gain the flexibility to implement the most secure token management strategy tailored to their specific security needs. Moreover, shifting the responsibility to the container application for updating the 'access_token' input ensures that any changes or refreshes to the authToken are securely managed within the application's domain. This proactive approach effectively mitigates potential security vulnerabilities associated with token management, offering a robust and adaptable solution.
