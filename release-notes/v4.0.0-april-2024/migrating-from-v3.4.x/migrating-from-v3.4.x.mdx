### Revised cache key organization

To ensure a smooth transition to the 4.0 release, it's essential to utilize the following clear cache endpoint and body:

##### Endpoint:

`POST {{baseUrlAdmin}}/api/internal/cache/clear`

##### Body:

```json
{
    "cacheNames": [
        "flowx:core:cache"
        ]
}
```

<Info>
This endpoint is designed to purge Redis caches selectively. It will exclusively delete caches that are specified in the admin microservice properties under the property key: "application.redis.clearable-caches".

| manage-themes | import | ROLE_THEMES_IMPORT | Content Management |

### Logging

To streamline logging and enhance readability, you can now disable health endpoint calls cluttering the logs of various deployed FlowX microservices using the following environment variables:

- `LOGGING_LEVEL_WEB: INFO` (default)
- `LOGGING_LEVEL_ORG_SPRINGFRAMEWORK_WEB: INFO` (default)

<Info>
If logs lack detail, consider setting the value to ‘DEBUG’.
