In this exhilarating update, we've added a bunch of cool stuff. From a **new theming feature** to a complete overhaul of **navigation**, killing the **milestones nodes** (we know you hated them), brace yourself for a transformative journey through the latest features and enhancements...and also a surprise for you, awaiting at the [**bottom of the page**](#coming-soon)!

## Bonus: meme of the day 

Start with a laugh, because it will be a lot to read!

Let's dive in and explore the exhilarating additions:

## **What's New?** üÜï

### Themes: Elevate Your Experience

The new **Theme Management** feature enhances our design process by establishing a unified visual language across various platforms. 

<Frame>

</Frame>

This approach simplifies development by enabling the establishment of a foundational **theme**, which can then be customized to accommodate specific platform requirements.

- **Timer event scheduler**: Significant optimizations have been implemented in the timer event scheduler, resulting in improved efficiency and responsiveness.
- **UI Designer** updates and improvements.
- UI Designer components style and props changes - consult the [**UI Designer change log**](./migrating-from-v3.x/ui-designer-changelog) for more information.
- Revised cache key organization. Read more [**here**](./migrating-from-v3.x/migrating-from-v3.x#revised-cache-key-organization).

## **Bug Fixes** üõ†Ô∏è

We've also squashed pesky bugs to ensure a smoother and more reliable experience across the board.

### Scheduler

* Tokens now leave the timer node promptly, no longer lingering like last-minute shoppers before closing time!
* Subprocesses can now rest easy knowing they won't trigger "Timer expression is not valid" errors when setting process expiry time in months‚Äîour code's time management just got a promotion!

### UI Designer

* Switch element label now obeys orders to move to the end‚Äîno more rebellious labels sticking to the start!

### Process Designer

* Small laptops users rejoice! Now you can scroll to see all subprocesses and audit logs without losing the last line‚Äîno more screen envy for external monitors!
* Start Subprocess Action now consistently saves selected version inputs and allows for multiple edits without page refreshes‚Äîno more need for extra clicks or browser gymnastics!
* Nodes now stay within swimlane borders when moved, preventing them from wandering off like lost sheep‚Äîno more unexpected node relocations disrupting your process layouts!

### FlowX Engine

* MVEL parser now (with the latest MVEL version update: 2.5.2) happily accepts arrays/lists after objects, eliminating JSON file frustrations and improving developer workflow‚Äîno more cryptic error messages ruining your day!
* Python Business Rules now reliably execute during runtime, ensuring consistent behavior between test and live modes‚Äîno more mysterious token standstills!

### Web SDK

* You can now seamlessly execute actions in processes with radio buttons and validators, even after page reloads‚Äîeliminating the frustration of encountering unresponsive buttons.
* Also you can now successfully execute UI Actions on image components without encountering "undefined token uuid" errors‚Äîno more frustrations with unresponsive image interactions!
* Custom validators now retain their specified async execution type upon saving, ensuring consistency and reliability in process validation‚Äîno more frustrating switches back to sync execution!
* Forget playing favorites in the WEB_SDK! Now you can save data from both form elements and UI action custom body simultaneously. Say goodbye to tough decisions‚Äîsaving data just got a whole lot easier and funnier!
