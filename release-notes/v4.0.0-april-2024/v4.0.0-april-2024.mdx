Let's dive in and explore the exhilarating additions:

## **What's New?** 🆕

### Themes: Elevate Your Experience

The new **Theme Management** feature enhances our design process by establishing a unified visual language across various platforms. 

<Frame>

</Frame>

This approach simplifies development by enabling the establishment of a foundational **theme**, which can then be customized to accommodate specific platform requirements.

<Frame>

</Frame>

Ultimately, this streamlines the development process, saving significant time and effort.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title ="Design Tokens" icon ="pen-ruler">
* **Design Tokens**: Represent the single source of truth for the theme, storing visual elements of the design system.
* **Color Palette, Shadows, Typography Tokens**: Configure these tokens based on your company's brand guidelines. They ensure reusability and consistency.

In this release, we've bid farewell to **Milestone Nodes**, ushering in a fresh and improved approach to organizing the user interface. Say hello to a sleeker and more efficient system with the introduction of [**Navigation areas**](../../docs/building-blocks/process/navigation-areas).

<Info>
For process definitions originating from releases earlier than **4.0**, Milestone nodes will evolve into [**Zones**](../../docs/building-blocks/process/navigation-areas#zone) during migration, offering enhanced navigation capabilities.

## **Changed** 🔧

### Web SDK

* **AuthToken Management**: The ui-sdk no longer relies on the authToken being stored in LOCAL_STORAGE. Instead, the 'access_token' is now passed as an input to the `<flx-process-renderer>` component through a private variable.

<Warning>
**Breaking Change:** This update is mandatory for proper functionality of SSE (Server-Sent Events).
</Warning>

<Info>
By adopting this approach, clients gain the flexibility to implement the most secure token management strategy tailored to their specific security needs. Moreover, shifting the responsibility to the container application for updating the 'access_token' input ensures that any changes or refreshes to the authToken are securely managed within the application's domain. This proactive approach effectively mitigates potential security vulnerabilities associated with token management, offering a robust and adaptable solution.
</Info>

### Call activity node

* The **Subprocess Run** node is now called **Call activity** node.

### Business Rules

-  `output.put` method is required to generate structured output data when using `input` to validate or filter incoming data based on certain conditions (commonly used to retrieve information needed for processing )

### Timer event scheduler
 
- **Enhanced Performance**: Significant optimizations have been implemented in the timer event scheduler, resulting in improved efficiency and responsiveness.

### UI Designer

- Added **Styles** options for Modals
- All primary and secondary buttons, they transformed to fill buttons
- Removed card style property from UI Designer: **border** or *raised*.
- Icons color settings have a “No Color” override option, which allows the icon (SVG) to be rendered with its original color setting after theme options is applied to it.
- Added "Has accordion" option (Collapsed/Expanded) to **File Preview** UI component.

### Logging improvements

- New environment variables to prevent log flooding, check the [**deployment guidelines**](./deployment-guidelines-v4.0.0#logging) for more information.

## **Bug Fixes** 🛠️

We've also squashed pesky bugs to ensure a smoother and more reliable experience across the board.

### Scheduler

* Tokens now leave the timer node promptly, no longer lingering like last-minute shoppers before closing time!
* Subprocesses can now rest easy knowing they won't trigger "Timer expression is not valid" errors when setting process expiry time in months—our code's time management just got a promotion!

### UI Designer

* Switch element label now obeys orders to move to the end—no more rebellious labels sticking to the start!

### Process Designer

* Small laptops users rejoice! Now you can scroll to see all subprocesses and audit logs without losing the last line—no more screen envy for external monitors!
* Start Subprocess Action now consistently saves selected version inputs and allows for multiple edits without page refreshes—no more need for extra clicks or browser gymnastics!
* Nodes now stay within swimlane borders when moved, preventing them from wandering off like lost sheep—no more unexpected node relocations disrupting your process layouts!

### FlowX Engine

* MVEL parser now (with the latest MVEL version update: 2.5.2) happily accepts arrays/lists after objects, eliminating JSON file frustrations and improving developer workflow—no more cryptic error messages ruining your day!
* Python Business Rules now reliably execute during runtime, ensuring consistent behavior between test and live modes—no more mysterious token standstills!

### Web SDK

* You can now seamlessly execute actions in processes with radio buttons and validators, even after page reloads—eliminating the frustration of encountering unresponsive buttons.
* Also you can now successfully execute UI Actions on image components without encountering "undefined token uuid" errors—no more frustrations with unresponsive image interactions!
* Custom validators now retain their specified async execution type upon saving, ensuring consistency and reliability in process validation—no more frustrating switches back to sync execution!
* Forget playing favorites in the WEB_SDK! Now you can save data from both form elements and UI action custom body simultaneously. Say goodbye to tough decisions—saving data just got a whole lot easier and funnier!
