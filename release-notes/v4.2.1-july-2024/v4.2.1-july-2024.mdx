title: FlowX.AI 4.2.1 Release
description: We are excited to announce the release FlowX.AI 4.2.1 üî•, featuring new and improved features that will elevate your workflow experience.
---

Let's dive in and explore:

## **What's New?** üÜï

### Web Renderer

Changes were made to the icons module configuration to allow the addition of a custom icon dictionary.

#### Old configuration

The previous configuration imported the FlxIconModule with an extra icon set directly in the imports array.

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [...],
  imports: [
    FlxIconModule.withExtraIconSet(EXTRA_ICON_SET)
  ]
)
```

#### New configuration

The new configuration separates the extra icon set from the imports array and places it in the providers array. This change allows for extending the existing icon set with a custom icon dictionary while still keeping the `FlxIconModule` in the imports array to use the `flx-icon` component.

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [...],
  imports: [
    FlxIconModule // keep the module in order to be able to use the flx-icon component
  ],
  providers: [
    provideExtraIconSet(EXTRA_ICON_SET) // extend the existing icon set with a custom icon dictionary
  ]
)
```

### FlowX.AI Engine - Scripting UX improvements

## Bug Fixes üõ†Ô∏è

### FlowX.AI Engine

- Fixed duplicate key error. This issue was caused by conflicting keys in processes with start embedded subprocesses nodes and throw/catch message events. The key management logic was updated to ensure unique keys, resolving the error.
- Fixed an issue where executing a business rule with the same input sometimes caused the process engine to return an error. Implemented null checks in the business rule script, regular cache clearing, and enhanced error logging for improved debugging.
