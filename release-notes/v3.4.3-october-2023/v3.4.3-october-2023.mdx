## **Bug Fixes** üîß

###  Notification and Document plugins
- Fixed limited entries problem in Document plugin and Notification plugin, previously restricted to 20 entries.
- Resolved the issue causing the Document plugin to restart when starting with lag in Kafka topics.

### Web SDK
- Addressed CSS class assignment for `<flx-text>` issue, ensuring correct class assignment.
- Fixed a UI issue where adding a left margin to COLLECTION_PROTOTYPE caused it to extend beyond the parent card.
- Corrected a bug in certain UI elements where selecting a 2nd level child value didn't clear when the parent value was updated.
- Resolved rendering issues for '0' and '-' values in text elements.

### Designer and Versioning

- Fixed the Designer issue where options in certain UI elements weren't displayed in dropdowns after previous selections.
- Resolved the Import Published Version Selection issue during process import, now displaying only available versions.

### Admin

- Fixed an issue that previously prevented the creation of new versions for processes with swimlane names containing empty spaces.

## **Other Bits**

* We've bid farewell to the autoarrange function in the [**Process Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer).

## **Gremlins to Watch Out For** üôÅ

Keep an eye out for these quirks:

* **Document preview UI element**: Our document preview component has a unique sense of style. It prefers to take up only a portion of the screen, even when told to "fill" the entire width. It's a rebel with a cause.
* **Business rules**: Our business rule have a language barrier, but they're working on it. Changing the language of a business rule doesn't always lead to using the new language for execution. It's like they have a favorite phrase they won't let go of.
* **Process Designer**: Deleting a boundary node in the process designer and coming back from the UI Designer doesn't always clean up the associated sequence from the boundary event. It's like they left a party and forgot their hat.
* **Datepicker Date Transformation**: Our Datepicker seems to possess a hidden talent. It mysteriously transforms random text into the current date when used with validators in UI Designer.
