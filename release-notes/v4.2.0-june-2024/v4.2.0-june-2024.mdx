### FlowX.AI Engine

#### Autocomputed data to send

In previous platform versions, when creating your UI screens, you had to ensure that all the data stored in your process keys was sent to the frontend application. This required adding an extra parameter called "Data to send" to the "Save Data" node action.

Now, with the autocompute feature, this step is no longer necessary, as the data is automatically sent to the frontend application by default.

However, you still have the option to customize which keys are included or excluded as needed.

### Process Designer

We're excited to announce significant improvements to our scripting UX. These enhancements focus on upgrading the code editors and introducing an advanced autocomplete feature. Configurators, both experienced and novice, will benefit from better visual feedback, support for interpolation syntax, and integrated help and examples. 

The updates aim to streamline the configuration process, reduce errors, and make testing and troubleshooting more efficient.


## **Changes**  ðŸ”§



## Gremlins to Watch Out For

Keep an eye out for these quirks:

- **UI Designer**: When relocating UI elements between parents, the elements' order doesn't always get the memo, causing a mix-up in the family tree. We're untangling this knot!
