## **What's new? 🆕**

✅ Updated Spring Boot to version 3.4.5      
✅ Added retry mechanism for ES indexing to handle key‑identifier errors                      
✅ Fixed critical build export timeout issues      
✅ Improved reporting data representation           
✅ Enhanced cross-platform consistency                  

## Spring Boot update 

### Updated to Spring Boot 3.4.5

We've updated our Spring Boot dependency to version 3.4.5:

- Enhanced system stability
- Latest security patches
- Improved performance


### Elasticsearch indexing - configurable retry mechanism


- `OPTIMISTIC_LOCKING_RETRIES`: Number of times the engine will retry indexing when it encounters concurrent-update errors specifically on key identifiers during their update after an action.

## **Bug fixes** 🐞  

- **Build export timeouts**: Resolved intermittent timeout failures on projects with dependency libraries; exports now consistently complete or retry correctly.  
- **Build creation on merge without conflicts**: Fixed an issue where merging one branch into another without conflicts—and switching the active policy—did not trigger a new build, forcing users to manually create a version; now, merges automatically update build resources and create the new version so merged changes appear at runtime.
- **Project version import stashing conflict**: Resolved an error where importing a branched project version across environments would inadvertently stash other versions—restoring successful import, fixing the GET history API response, and ensuring the Project versions history modal renders correctly.
- **CosmosDB workflows**: Fixed an issue preventing the workflow instances list from loading in the Integration Designer when using CosmosDB.  
- **Reporting arrays**: Corrected array formatting in the `reporting_data` table (process-engine schema) so that fields like `client.Address[].StreetName` and `client.Names[]` display properly.  
- **CMS permissions**: Restored backward compatibility for FlowX SDK v4.7+ by removing the unintended `media_library_read` requirement for processes containing images (behavior now matches v4.1).  
- **onChange action behavior**: Standardized onChange/onBlur across web, Android, and iOS so users cannot continue typing after token advancement unless explicitly allowed.  
- **React SDK ternary expressions**: Fixed an “Invalid Expression” error in SDK v5.86.1—ternary expressions in computed values (e.g. `return ${var1} ? "Onboarded" : (${var2} ? "Non-eligible" : "Ready for Onboarding");`) now parse correctly as they did in v5.62.1.
- **Elasticsearch indexing**: Fixed an issue where the engine was not retrying to index process instances when it encountered concurrent-update errors on key identifiers.
