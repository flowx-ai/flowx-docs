## **What's new?** ðŸ†•

### Application

The new Application concept introduces a streamlined approach to managing and deploying complex projects within FlowX. By grouping all related resourcesâ€”such as processes, enumerations, integrations, and assetsâ€”into a single, organized workspace, applications provide a cohesive view for efficient development and deployment.

This feature supports version control at the application level, allowing users to create and manage multiple versions and builds. Applications also facilitate resource sharing through dependencies, enabling the reuse of processes and configurations across projects. These enhancements make it easier to maintain project integrity, deploy updates seamlessly, and ensure consistency across environments. Here is a quick walkthrough demo:

#### Config vs build

* Config mode is the environment where you set up, adjust, and manage your application's resources, processes, and configurations. It's the workspace where you fine-tune every aspect of the application before it's ready for deployment. Think of it as the design phase, where the focus is on setup, organization, and preparation.
* Build mode is the stage where the configurations you've set up are packaged into a deployable form. This is the runtime-ready version of your application, containing everything needed for it to function in a production environment. A build includes a snapshot of the applicationâ€™s state at a given point, ensuring stability and predictability when deployed.

### Integration Designer

The Integration Designer simplifies the integration of FlowX with external systems using REST APIs. It offers a user-friendly graphical interface with intuitive drag-and-drop functionality for defining data models, orchestrating workflows, and configuring system endpoints.

With Integration Designer, you can easily set up REST-based connections and define workflows, while enjoying flexible authorization options such as Service Token, Bearer, or No Auth.

<Tip>
**Did you know?**

Unlike [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), which focuses on API testing, the Integration Designer automates workflows between systems. With drag-and-drop ease, it handles REST API connections, real-time processes, and error management, making integrations seamless and scalable.

### Autocomputed data to send

In previous platform versions, when creating your UI screens and working with data, you had to ensure that all the data stored in your process keys was saved in the process instance. This required adding an extra parameter called "Data to send" to the "Save Data" node action.


**Older versions** vs **v4.5**:

<Frame>
<Frame><img height="200" alt="older versions" src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/4.x-aut.png"/> </Frame> <Frame> <img height="200" alt="v.4.5" src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/4.2-aut.png"/> </Frame>
</Frame>


Now, with the autocompute feature, this step is no longer necessary, as the data is automatically saved and sent on your process instance.


<Tip>

You no longer need to add "Save Data" node actions, but make sure to include "Forms to Validate" on the UI Actions. This helps ensure that data is submitted correctly and automatically activates any added validators where they exist.

<Frame>

</Frame>

However, you still have the option to customize which keys are included or excluded as needed.
