Get ready because this update is bigâ€”really big. Weâ€™re taking the scenic route to explore all the exciting new features and improvements that you wonâ€™t want to miss, so get ready. Thereâ€™s a lot to explore here (and yes, that pun is courtesy of our AI, since even our technical writer was stumped on how to market this one).
Before diving in, here is a bonus meme:

## **What's new?** ðŸ†•

### Application

The new Application concept introduces a streamlined approach to managing and deploying complex projects within FlowX. By grouping all related resourcesâ€”such as processes, enumerations, integrations, and assetsâ€”into a single, organized workspace, applications provide a cohesive view for efficient development and deployment.

</Frame>


This feature supports version control at the application level, allowing users to create and manage multiple versions and builds. Applications also facilitate resource sharing through dependencies, enabling the reuse of processes and configurations across projects. These enhancements make it easier to maintain project integrity, deploy updates seamlessly, and ensure consistency across environments. Here is a quick walkthrough demo:

#### Config vs build

* Config mode is the environment where you set up, adjust, and manage your application's resources, processes, and configurations. It's the workspace where you fine-tune every aspect of the application before it's ready for deployment. Think of it as the design phase, where the focus is on setup, organization, and preparation.
* Build mode is the stage where the configurations you've set up are packaged into a deployable form. This is the runtime-ready version of your application, containing everything needed for it to function in a production environment. A build includes a snapshot of the applicationâ€™s state at a given point, ensuring stability and predictability when deployed.

### Integration Designer

The Integration Designer simplifies the integration of FlowX with external systems using REST APIs. It offers a user-friendly graphical interface with intuitive drag-and-drop functionality for defining data models, orchestrating workflows, and configuring system endpoints.

With Integration Designer, you can easily set up REST-based connections and define workflows, while enjoying flexible authorization options such as Service Token, Bearer, or No Auth.

<Tip>
**Did you know?**

Unlike [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), which focuses on API testing, the Integration Designer automates workflows between systems. With drag-and-drop ease, it handles REST API connections, real-time processes, and error management, making integrations seamless and scalable.

### UI Designer

#### Grid layout 

We are excited to introduce the Grid Layout feature in this release, enhancing the flexibility and usability of the UI Designer for creating structured and responsive layouts. With the new Grid Layout, users can organize form elements, tables, and other components using a multi-column and row system, allowing for more complex, bidirectional designs compared to the previous flex-based layout.

### Task management



### Autocomputed data to send

In previous platform versions, when creating your UI screens and working with data, you had to ensure that all the data stored in your process keys was saved in the process instance. This required adding an extra parameter called "Data to send" to the "Save Data" node action.


**Older versions** vs **v4.5**:

<Frame>
<Frame><img height="200" alt="older versions" src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/4.x-aut.png"/> </Frame> <Frame> <img height="200" alt="v.4.5" src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/4.2-aut.png"/> </Frame>
</Frame>


Now, with the autocompute feature, this step is no longer necessary, as the data is automatically saved and sent on your process instance.


<Tip>

You no longer need to add "Save Data" node actions, but make sure to include "Forms to Validate" on the UI Actions. This helps ensure that data is submitted correctly and automatically activates any added validators where they exist.

<Frame>

However, you still have the option to customize which keys are included or excluded as needed.

### Scripting UX improvements

We're excited to announce significant improvements to our scripting UX. These enhancements focus on upgrading the code editors and introducing an advanced autocomplete feature. Configurators, both experienced and novice, will benefit from better visual feedback, support for interpolation syntax, and integrated help and examples. 

The updates aim to streamline the configuration process, reduce errors, and make testing and troubleshooting more efficient.

#### Autocomplete based on data model

Autocomplete for attributes is now available, improving configuration efficiency by offering tailored suggestions based on data model attributes. These enhancements apply to various fields and editors, including JSON, code, and JavaScript editors, as well as input fields across different node configurations, UI components, and business rules.

#### New test business rule editor
