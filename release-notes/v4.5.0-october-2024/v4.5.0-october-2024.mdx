Buckle up for an update, which is as ambitious as it is game-changing. We've packed this release with so much innovation that you might want to break out your favorite snack, get comfortable, and prepare because there's a lot to unpack. So let's dive in:


## **What's New?** ðŸ†•

### Grid Layout Introduction

We are excited to introduce the Grid Layout feature in this release, enhancing the flexibility and usability of the UI Designer for creating structured and responsive layouts. With the new Grid Layout, users can organize form elements, tables, and other components using a multi-column and row system, allowing for more complex, bidirectional designs compared to the previous flex-based layout.

### FlowX.AI Engine

#### Autocomputed data to send

In previous platform versions, when creating your UI screens and working with data, you had to ensure that all the data stored in your process keys was saved in the process instance. This required adding an extra parameter called "Data to send" to the "Save Data" node action.


**Older versions** vs **v4.5**:

</Frame>


Now, with the autocompute feature, this step is no longer necessary, as the data is automatically saved and sent on your process instance.


<Tip>

You no longer need to add "Save Data" node actions, but make sure to include "Forms to Validate" on the UI Actions. This helps ensure that data is submitted correctly and automatically activates any added validators where they exist.

However, you still have the option to customize which keys are included or excluded as needed.

### Scripting UX improvements

We're excited to announce significant improvements to our scripting UX. These enhancements focus on upgrading the code editors and introducing an advanced autocomplete feature. Configurators, both experienced and novice, will benefit from better visual feedback, support for interpolation syntax, and integrated help and examples. 

The updates aim to streamline the configuration process, reduce errors, and make testing and troubleshooting more efficient.

#### Autocomplete based on data model

Introducing autocomplete for attributes, tailored to the data model attributes for enhanced configuration efficiency:
