title: Configuration and migration guide 
description: This guide outlines changes in process and UI configuration from v4.1.x to 4.5.0 version.

## Applications

The **Applications** feature in FlowX AI v4.5.0 is a new structure that organizes all dependencies and resources required for a project into a single deployable view. This enhancement simplifies configuration, deployment, and maintenance by layering applications on top of processes, offering a centralized workspace that encapsulates everything needed for project execution.

Several key configuration changes impact how resources and dependencies are managed, deployed, and maintained. This guide provides a breakdown of the configuration changes, automatic migration processes, and manual steps required to ensure a smooth transition.

### Consolidated resource management

- **Change**: All resources that were previously managed individually within processes are now grouped within Applications. This includes content management elements, integrations, themes, task configurations, and permissions.
- **Impact**: Resources like **enumerations**, **substitution tags**, and **generic parameters** are now managed within Applications, allowing centralized configuration and version control.
- **Migration**: All process-related resources will be migrated automatically into a **default application**, ensuring continuity of functionality in the new framework. After migration, you should verify that all critical resources are correctly configured within this default application.

### Enhanced version control and dependency management

- **Impact**: Applications support **dependency management** through **Libraries** and enforce version-controlled resources. Setting up an application now requires careful dependency management and versioning to prevent unintended updates.
- **Benefit**: Allows for modular, reusable resources and stable deployments across applications, reducing resource duplication and enhancing project compatibility.


### Migration checklist

1. **Verify Process Migration**: Confirm that all existing process definitions have been correctly migrated into the default application.
2. **Set Configuration Parameter Overrides**: Post-deployment, adjust environment-specific Configuration Parameters in the default application.
3. **Update Task Views**: Replace the global "All Tasks" feature with application-specific Views in each application.
4. **Transfer Processes and Dependencies Manually**: If moving a process from the default application to another application, manually transfer associated resources and check the dependencies.

## Generic parameters migration

* **Overview**: In version 4.5.0, global generic parameters (from versions prior to 4.5.0) have been migrated to application-level as Configuration Parameters, consolidating parameter management within specific applications for improved organization and control.

* **Migration**: All generic parameters will be automatically migrated to Configuration Parameters section under a default application.
* **Business Rules Unaffected**: There is no impact on existing business rules; they will continue to function as before without requiring updates.
* **Process Export Considerations**: If you export a process from one application to another, ensure that you also transfer the associated configuration parameters. This step is crucial to maintain process functionality and consistency across applications.
* **Important Note**: Only values of generic parameters associated with the specific environment, or where `env = null` (displayed as "all" in the interface in versions prior to 4.5.0), will be migrated. You must ensure that you have correctly set the values for generic parameters, paying attention to environment values (which are case-sensitive), and export these generic parameters before migration to avoid any potential data loss.

* **Post-Deployment Step**: After the first deployment to an upper environment, you will need to create configuration parameter overrides with the specific values required for that environment. This ensures that all environment-specific configurations are accurately maintained and applied across different deployment stages.

<Tip>
To set configuration parameter overrides, navigate to **Your App -> Runtime -> Configuration Parameters Overrides**.

## Task management

* "All Tasks" as a View: The global "All Tasks" feature is no longer standalone and will now function as a View in an application.
