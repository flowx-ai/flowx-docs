* **Migration**: All generic parameters will be automatically migrated to Configuration Parameters section under a default application.
* **Business Rules Unaffected**: There is no impact on existing business rules; they will continue to function as before without requiring updates.
* **Process Export Considerations**: If you export a process from one application to another, ensure that you also transfer the associated configuration parameters. This step is crucial to maintain process functionality and consistency across applications.
