## **What's new?** üÜï

### **Integration designer updates**

- **Testing on Upper Environments:** Test endpoints and workflows in upper environments with customizable configurations and detailed runtime logs for smooth and accurate testing.
- **System Enumeration Toggle:**  Manage system enumeration mapping with a new toggle.  
  - **ON:** Includes the system in the enumeration table and enables the Enum Mapper.  
  - **OFF:** Removes the system, disables related mappings, and clears existing data with a warning.
- **Duplicate Workflow & Endpoint:** Streamline the creation of similar workflows or endpoints with the "Duplicate" option. Includes support for renaming, optional descriptions, and independent modifications. Success or error notifications ensure clarity.
- **Testing on Committed Versions:** Test endpoints and workflows on committed versions with editable inputs, detailed logs, and response previews displayed in tailored modals.
- **Enum Translation in Lists:** Expanded support for enum translation in lists of objects and arrays of enums, with simplified JSON path formatting for enhanced efficiency.
- **Multiple Incoming Sequences:**  Workflow nodes now support multiple incoming sequences, enabling complex designs where conditions or actions converge.
- **Rename Workflow Nodes:** Added in-place editing for workflow node names, ensuring unique and compliant naming through validations.
- **Show System-Auth Details in Test Modal:** Introduced visibility for system-auth details directly in the test modal, improving debugging and configuration insights.
- **Default Retry Values for REST Endpoints:** Updated default retry values for REST endpoints to enhance reliability and optimize configurations.
- **Start/Call Subworkflow Node (Sync):** Added a new node that allows reusing predefined workflows (local or library) within parent workflows. Subworkflows complete before proceeding and halt the parent workflow on failure.
- **Configurable Timeout & Retry Mechanisms:** Endpoint nodes now allow configurable timeouts (default: 10,000 ms) and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, ensuring resilience during API interactions.
- **Missing Sequence Alerts:**  Workflow nodes with unmapped branches now display a yellow warning icon, providing actionable guidance to resolve missing sequences.

#### Hide expressions enhancements

The [**Hide Expressions**](../../4.5.0/docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/input-form-field#hidedisable-expressions) feature is now standardized across all FlowX components extending functionality to collection prototypes, table cell children, and more.  

Supported components include:  

- Card
- Collection
- Collection Prototype children (excluding the Collection Prototype itself)
- Text
- Link
- Image
- File Preview
- File Upload
- Button
- Table cell children (e.g.: texts, images, buttons, links)

#### Grid improvements in preview

- Enhanced grid placeholder design.  
- Added drag-and-drop support for placeholder column and row spans.


#### Table UI component enhancements 

Added in-place editing and validations for table cells, along with support for row deletions.

#### Conditional formatting for UI elements

This release introduces the ability to dynamically change styling and configuration properties of UI elements based on specified conditions. You can set multiple conditions and corresponding styling overrides‚Äîsuch as colors, fonts, and borders‚Äîand update Image or Document URLs contextually. This enhancement reduces the need for multiple prototypes, simplifies the UI configuration process, and makes it easier to highlight data patterns, outliers, or trends directly within the interface.

### Analytics integration for container apps

Container apps now support tracking "Screen Displayed" and "Action Executed" events, configurable in the UI Designer to improve insights into user interactions.

**UI Designer updates**:

* **Analytics Screen Name**: Configurable under Root UI components (Cards and Containers) to enable tracking in analytics platforms like Google Analytics.  


<Tip>
"Screen Displayed" events support user task-based reporting, such as when a user task screen is shown.

<Info>
Values are saved in `params.analytics` via the PATCH `/actions` request.
</Info>

**Renderers updates**:

Renderers now expose a public API for triggering analytics events:

- **Screen Events**: Triggered on user task display, using `flowxProps.analytics`.
- **Action Events**: Triggered on action execution, using `params.analytics`.

Dynamic values such as process store keys and replace tags are supported for more contextual tracking.
