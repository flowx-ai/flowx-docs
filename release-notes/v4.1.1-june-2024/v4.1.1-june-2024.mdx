Let's dive in and explore:

## **What's New?** ðŸ†•

### FlowX.AI Engine: Process Instance Data Archiving

<Info>
Database Compatibility: Oracle and Postgres.
</Info>


We are introducing a new system for archiving data related to old process instances. This enables the implementation of data retention policies, with more predictable storage usage and costs. 

<Tip>
Some operations involving process instance data can be snappier, given the lower amount of data and new structure. Archiving relies on partitioning data based on the process instance start time. Each partition is associated with a time period (day, week, month), and retention is defined by the number of periods maintained in the system.
</Tip>

Archived data remains in new tables the database, optionally compressed, and is no longer accessible in FlowX. These tables can be compressed, copied, moved, archived, or deleted without affecting other processes in FlowX.

## **Changes**  ðŸ”§

### Task Manager: base URL configuration

We have enhanced the Task Manager plugin by adding the ability to update the baseUrl for tasks. If the `task.baseUrl` is specified in the process parameters, it will now be sent to the Task Manager to update the tasks accordingly.

Example of a Business Rule:

```java
output.put("task", {"baseUrl": "https://your_base_url"});
```
This update streamlines the configuration process, ensuring that task URLs are dynamically updated and properly managed within the Task Manager.

## Gremlins to Watch Out For

Keep an eye out for these quirks:

- **UI Designer**: When relocating UI elements between parents, the elements' order doesn't always get the memo, causing a mix-up in the family tree. We're untangling this knot!
