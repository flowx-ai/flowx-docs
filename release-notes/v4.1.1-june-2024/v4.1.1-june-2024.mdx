Let's dive in and explore:

## **What's New?** üÜï

### Process Instance Data Partitioning & Archiving

## **Bug Fixes** üõ†Ô∏è

We've also squashed pesky bugs to ensure a smoother and more reliable experience across the board.

- **Process Designer**: The error hiccups with embedded subprocesses and their error events have been smoothed out! No more getting stuck in a loop; now, you'll gracefully proceed to the embedded subprocess as expected.
- **Process Designer**: The versioning hiccup causing merge conflicts when trying to merge a branch with a main branch that wasn't imported into the environment has been fixed!
- **UI Designer**: The slider UI element's identity crisis has been resolved. No longer will it confuse its maximum value with its minimum counterpart.
- **UI Designer**: Concatenation glitch in text elements, where values from the collection prototype play hide and seek, has been patched up! No more disappearing acts - they'll be displayed side by side as intended.
- **UI Designer**: The glitch preventing the assignment of actions in button UI Actions with blank spaces in their names has been smoothed out!

## Gremlins to Watch Out For

- **UI Designer**: When relocating UI elements between parents, the elements' order doesn't always get the memo, causing a mix-up in the family tree. We're untangling this knot!
