## Migrating from v4.1 to v4.1.1

<Warning>
Before upgrading to v4.1.1, execute initial data partitioning setup manually. This is needed no matter if you enable partitioning or not.

Therefore, when starting the new version of the process-engine, we recommend manually executing the setup SQL commands from Liquibase, as they may take more time. After setup, all existing information will go into the initial partition.
</Warning>

<Info>
If partitioning is enabled, the initial partition will continue to be used until a new `partition_id` is generated according to the partitioning interval (DAY, WEEK, MONTH). Future partitions will be created automatically.

If partitioning is not enabled, all data will continue to be stored in this initial partition.
