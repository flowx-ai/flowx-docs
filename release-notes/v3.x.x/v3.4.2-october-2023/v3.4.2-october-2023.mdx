---

## **What's new**

### Web Renderer - Enhanced SSE Connection Handling

* Introducing the `LEGACY_HTTP_VERSION` variable: When set to `true`, it will automatically disconnect the Server-Sent Events (SSE) tab when it becomes inactive, and then seamlessly reconnect and retrieve the status when it becomes active. By default, `LEGACY_HTTP_VERSION` is set to `false`, meaning there will be no SSE disconnection when switching tabs, ensuring a smoother user experience.


<Warning>
Set `LEGACY_HTTP_VERSION` to `true` only for HTTP versions < 2 to ensure proper SSE functionality. It can be omitted for other cases.
</Warning>

## **Bug Fixes** üîß

* Addressed various bugs from previous versions to enhance stability and reliability.

### Other Bits

* We've bid farewell to the autoarrange function in the [**Process Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer).

## **Gremlins to Watch Out For** üôÅ

Keep an eye out for these quirks:

* **Slider UI element**: Our slider component can be a bit mysterious at times. Currently, it enjoys a game of hide-and-seek with the correct value when sourced from process data.
* **Document preview UI element**: Our document preview component has a unique sense of style. It prefers to take up only a portion of the screen, even when told to "fill" the entire width. It's a rebel with a cause.
* **Business rules**: Our business rule have a language barrier, but they're working on it. Changing the language of a business rule doesn't always lead to using the new language for execution. It's like they have a favorite phrase they won't let go of.
* **Process Designer**: Deleting a boundary node in the process designer and coming back from the UI Designer doesn't always clean up the associated sequence from the boundary event. It's like they left a party and forgot their hat.
* **Datepicker Date Transformation**: Our Datepicker seems to possess a hidden talent. It mysteriously transforms random text into the current date when used with validators in UI Designer.
* **Text Element Issue**: Our text element tends to vanish when set to "0" or "-". Expected it to show up, but it's playing hide-and-seek instead!
