title: v3.4.4 November 2023

In version 3.4.4 of FLOWX.AI, we have addressed some issues to improve the stability and reliability of the platform. Here are the key bug fixes in this release:

## **Bug Fixes** üîß

### FLOWX.AI Engine üöÇ

* Fixed an issue where sending an extra key when using [**bulk operations**](../../docs/platform-setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide#topics-related-to-the-task-management-plugin) was not working as expected. Now you can attach extra keys to the header and they will be copied to the response. See the example below:

### Web SDK

* Fixed a small performance issue

## **Other Bits**

* We've bid farewell to the autoarrange function in the [**Process Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer).

## **Gremlins to Watch Out For** üôÅ

Keep an eye out for these quirks:

* **Document preview UI element**: Our document preview component has a unique sense of style. It prefers to take up only a portion of the screen, even when told to "fill" the entire width. It's a rebel with a cause.
* **Business rules**: Our business rule have a language barrier, but they're working on it. Changing the language of a business rule doesn't always lead to using the new language for execution. It's like they have a favorite phrase they won't let go of.
* **Process Designer**: Deleting a boundary node in the process designer and coming back from the UI Designer doesn't always clean up the associated sequence from the boundary event. It's like they left a party and forgot their hat.
* **Datepicker Date Transformation**: Our Datepicker seems to possess a hidden talent. It mysteriously transforms random text into the current date when used with validators in UI Designer.
