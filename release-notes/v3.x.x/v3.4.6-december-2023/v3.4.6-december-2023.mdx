title: v3.4.6 December 2023 
---

In version 3.4.6 of FLOWX.AI, we have addressed some issues to improve the stability and reliability of the platform. Here are the key bug fixes in this release:


## **Bug Fixes** üîß

### Process Designer

- Cured a case of the "Start-Subprocess Stumper": now configuring existing start subprocess actions is a breeze! No more invisible barriers.

### Process Engine

- Liberated process versioning on Oracle from its migration woes! No more version control drama, it's all harmonious now.
- Put an end to the confusion: JavaScript arrays will no longer masquerade as Java maps. They've embraced their true identities.
- Our token instance ID DB index on Oracle has been reincarnated! It‚Äôs back and better than ever, ready to keep track of those elusive tokens.

### Versioning

- Put an end to the process definition merge branch mayhem! No more tangled branches, just clean, pristine definitions merging like old friends at a reunion.

## **Other Bits**

* We've bid farewell to the autoarrange function in the [**Process Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer).

## **Gremlins to Watch Out For** üôÅ

Keep an eye out for these quirks:

* **Document preview UI element**: Our document preview component has a unique sense of style. It prefers to take up only a portion of the screen, even when told to "fill" the entire width. It's a rebel with a cause.
* **Business rules**: Our business rule have a language barrier, but they're working on it. Changing the language of a business rule doesn't always lead to using the new language for execution. It's like they have a favorite phrase they won't let go of.
* **Process Designer**: Deleting a boundary node in the process designer and coming back from the UI Designer doesn't always clean up the associated sequence from the boundary event. It's like they left a party and forgot their hat.
* **Datepicker Date Transformation**: Our Datepicker seems to possess a hidden talent. It mysteriously transforms random text into the current date when used with validators in UI Designer.
