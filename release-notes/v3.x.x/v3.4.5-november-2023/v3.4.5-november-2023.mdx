title: v3.4.5 November 2023 
---

In version 3.4.5 of FLOWX.AI, we have addressed some issues to improve the stability and reliability of the platform. Here are the key bug fixes in this release:

## **Changed** üõ†Ô∏è

### Process Versioning

* **Delete process definition** - After deleting or renaming a process definition, you can now add a new one with the same name, whether manually or through import, without any limitations or constraints.

## **Bug Fixes** üîß

### Versioning

* Our version control got tangled in a game of interdimensional hopscotch, leaving branches stranded without their past travel tickets. We've straightened out the interdimensional portals now, ensuring that branches maintain their historical travel logs. No more lost branches in the space-time continuum!

### Web SDK

* **UI Designer** - We trained our containers in the art of origami, hoping they'd master the art of rearranging themselves gracefully. Unfortunately, they got carried away with their newfound skill and refused to listen when asked to reorder themselves properly. **We've had a serious talk with them, and now they promise to behave! You can copy, paste, and rearrange containers without them folding into chaos.**

## **Other Bits**

* We've bid farewell to the autoarrange function in the [**Process Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer).

## **Gremlins to Watch Out For** üôÅ

Keep an eye out for these quirks:

* **Document preview UI element**: Our document preview component has a unique sense of style. It prefers to take up only a portion of the screen, even when told to "fill" the entire width. It's a rebel with a cause.
* **Business rules**: Our business rule have a language barrier, but they're working on it. Changing the language of a business rule doesn't always lead to using the new language for execution. It's like they have a favorite phrase they won't let go of.
* **Process Designer**: Deleting a boundary node in the process designer and coming back from the UI Designer doesn't always clean up the associated sequence from the boundary event. It's like they left a party and forgot their hat.
* **Datepicker Date Transformation**: Our Datepicker seems to possess a hidden talent. It mysteriously transforms random text into the current date when used with validators in UI Designer.
