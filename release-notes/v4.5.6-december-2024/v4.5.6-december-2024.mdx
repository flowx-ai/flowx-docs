### Projects updates

#### Export media library with binaries

We‚Äôve introduced flexible export options to accommodate diverse deployment scenarios, including fully isolated environments:

* **With Binaries**: Packages now include all necessary binaries within the exported .zip file, enabling offline and on-premise usage where public URLs may not be accessible.

* **Without Binaries**: Retains the existing metadata-only approach, referencing publicly accessible binaries to keep export packages lightweight.

## Bug fixes üêû

* Change Document and Notification Plugin REST endpoint: Updated to use substring search for consistency with other endpoints.
* [Audit] Incorrect sent event: Resolved an issue where the Notification and Document templates audit recorded incorrect sent events.
* [Audit] Wrong subject identifier: Fixed a bug where the template's data model event used the wrong subject identifier when deleting the last entry.
