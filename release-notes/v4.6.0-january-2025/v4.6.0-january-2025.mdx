#### üõ† Config vs Build Mode

**Config Mode**: Tinker, tweak, and perfect.
    * Config mode is the environment where you set up, adjust, and manage your project's resources, processes, and configurations. It's the workspace where you fine-tune every aspect of the project before it's ready for deployment. Think of it as the design phase, where the focus is on setup, organization, and preparation.

**Build Mode**: Lock it, load it, deploy it.
    * Build mode is the stage where the configurations you've set up are packaged into a deployable form. This is the runtime-ready version of your project, containing everything needed for it to function in a production environment. A build includes a snapshot of the project‚Äôs state at a given point, ensuring stability and predictability when deployed.

</Frame>

API integration just got easier! Integration Designer simplifies connecting FlowX with external systems using REST APIs.

‚ú® **The magic of it**:

* **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Map data, define workflows, and configure endpoints like a breeze.
* **Flexible Authorization**: Use Service Tokens, Bearer tokens, or go authentication-free.
* **Error Management**: Built-in tools ensure your integrations don‚Äôt ghost you.

<Tip>
**Fun Fact**: Integration Designer doesn‚Äôt just test APIs (we love you, [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)‚ù§Ô∏è). It automates workflows, saving you tons of time.

</Frame>  

üß© **What‚Äôs New**: 

- **Advanced Conflict Detection**: Pinpoint issues by resource type (Processes, Enumerations, Media, etc.).  

<Frame>  
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/Merge%20Modal%20%281%29.png)  
</Frame> 

- **Resource-Level Resolution**: Resolve conflicts directly in the UI with:  
  - JSON comparisons (color-coded for clarity!).  
  - Navigation tools to jump between differences.  
  - Progress tracking for reviewed items.  


<Frame>

Handle unresolved conflicts with the **Merge Anyway** option, which provides flexibility while maintaining control over outcomes:

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Use the ‚ÄúMerge Anyway‚Äù option if you need to override unresolved conflicts (but use it wisely!).
</Tip>

- A confirmation modal explains how unresolved conflicts will be handled (e.g., prioritizing source branch changes).
- Allows merging to continue even when some conflicts remain unresolved.

### Custom components validation

You are able to validate and retrieve data from a generated screen, including data from a custom form section. Additionally, you‚Äôll have the ability to trigger and manage data directly within that section. This will be a major benefit for clients who have chosen to create custom components for the entire screen (for example, a form that isn‚Äôt supported natively by the platform).

### Autocomputed data to send

In previous platform versions, when creating your UI screens and working with data, you had to ensure that all the data stored in your process keys was saved in the process instance. This required adding an extra parameter called "Data to send" to the "Save Data" node action.


**Older versions** vs **v4.6.0**:

<Frame>
<Frame><img height="200" alt="older versions" src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/4.x-aut.png"/> </Frame> <Frame> <img height="200" alt="v.4.6" src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/4.2-aut.png"/> </Frame>
</Frame>


Now, with the autocompute feature, this step is no longer necessary, as the data is automatically saved and sent on your process instance.


<Tip>

You no longer need to add "Save Data" node actions, but make sure to include "Forms to Validate" on the UI Actions. This helps ensure that data is submitted correctly and automatically activates any added validators where they exist.

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/forms_to_validate.png)
</Frame>
</Tip>

However, you still have the option to customize which keys are included or excluded as needed.

## Bug fixes üêû

### Rendering

* **Default Value Initialization for UI Elements**: Resolved an issue where certain UI elements were initialized with incorrect default values.

* **Improved Security for Hidden Fields**: Fixed a vulnerability where hidden fields could be accessed through browser developer tools.

*  **Form Validation Reset on UI Dismissal**: Addressed an issue where form validation errors persisted after the UI was closed.

* **Keybinding Issues on Windows**: Fixed a bug where pressing specific keys triggered unintended operations in the designer.

* **Input Field Validation for Number Type**: Corrected the validation logic for number input fields to ensure consistent behavior.

* **Improved Datepicker Popup Positioning**: Resolved an issue where the datepicker popup overlapped the associated input field.

* **Manual Date Entry in Datepicker**: Fixed an issue where manually entering a date after selecting one from the datepicker caused errors.

* **Enhanced Update Mechanism for Custom Components**: Improved the reliability of updates for custom components to reflect changes consistently.

## Known issues üò¢

We‚Äôre aware of a few quirks during merge conflicts and are working to fix them. Here‚Äôs a quick rundown:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Processes">
* After a merge, sequences without a connection to an end node may appear on the canvas in cases of conflicts related to deleted nodes in one of the versions. This may occur because the merge mechanism does not detect that a sequence needs to be deleted if, in the final version, the node remains deleted.
* Navigation areas ‚Äì After a merge, inconsistencies in the navigation areas hierarchy calculated during merging may result in navigation areas being hidden in the final merged version.
* No merge conflict detected if a user task node is deleted in the source branch and its UI is modified in the destination branch.
* Nodes may end up having two different outgoing sequences in certain scenarios: When a node is not connected to another node, and both the source and target branches define different sequences to different nodes, the merged version may contain both sequences. In particular, this may cause inconsistencies for boundary nodes, which cannot have multiple outgoing sequences.
* Gateway nodes may lose some of their configurations during merging when conflicts arise.
* Conflicts arising from moving nodes to different swimlanes in both the source and target branches are not detected correctly and result in a merge error.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Enumerations">
* **Duplicate content values can be created during merging**: Merging branches with enumeration updates can result in duplicate content values or child enums with the same code. This occurs when identical names are added to the same enum in different branches, bypassing backend validation. Instead of flagging a conflict, the merge proceeds, creating duplicate entries. This issue disrupts the expected uniqueness constraint for enumeration values.
* **Enum content values might not save correctly in some cases**: In specific scenarios involving transformations of content values into child enums across branches, content values added in one branch may not appear after merging. Despite accepting changes from the branch where the content value was added, the merged version omits it, leading to incomplete or inconsistent enumeration data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Conflict Detection Gaps">
* **New substitution tags with the same name on different branches aren‚Äôt flagged**: Merging branches that include new substitution tags with identical names on different branches does not trigger a conflict. Instead, both tags are retained, resulting in duplicate substitution tags with the same name but different values. This issue bypasses expected conflict detection and can lead to inconsistencies in substitution tag usage.
* **Adding values to deleted data model keys does not raise conflicts**: When values are added to a data model key in one branch and the same key is deleted in another, merging does not generate a conflict. Instead, the added values from the first branch are silently lost in the merged version. This issue bypasses expected conflict detection, leading to data loss and inconsistencies in the resulting data model.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title = "Media Library">
* Branches with media library assets sometimes fail to merge into the main branch: Merging branches with media library assets can result in a 500 Internal Server Error when changes to the same asset occur across multiple branches. This issue typically arises when one branch is merged into another, and then the combined branch is merged into the main branch. The failure occurs due to null parameter handling during the merge process, preventing the merge from completing successfully.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Notification and document templates">
* Branches with notification and document templates fail to merge into the main branch
</Accordion>
<Accordion title ="UI/UX">
* After a successful merge, the merged version is not selected in the versioning modal.
* Some entries in the merge conflicts tree may show numbers instead of specific identifiers (e.g. forms);
* **Unnecessary scrollbars appear in the merge modal for single items**: The merge conflict modal displays unnecessary scrollbars when only a single item is present in the list. This occurs in scenarios where media library assets with long keys are involved, creating a layout issue that affects the user interface. While functionality is not impacted, this visual inconsistency can reduce the overall user experience during conflict resolution.
* **Fields like¬†`originalCreationTimestamp`¬†and¬†`flowxUuid`¬†are incorrectly flagged as conflicts**: The merge conflict modal displays unnecessary scrollbars when only a single item is present in the list. This occurs in scenarios where media library assets with long keys are involved, creating a layout issue that affects the user interface. While functionality is not impacted, this visual inconsistency can reduce the overall user experience during conflict resolution.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Changes üîß

- **Web Renderer Caching:** Improved resource caching with browser mechanisms keyed to build IDs.
- **Process Designer:** Enhanced drag-and-drop functionality for node placement.
