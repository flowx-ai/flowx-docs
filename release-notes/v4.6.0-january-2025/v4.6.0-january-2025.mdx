## **What's new?** üÜï


### Projects

The new Project concept introduces a streamlined approach to managing and deploying complex projects within FlowX. By grouping all related resources‚Äîsuch as processes, enumerations, integrations, and assets‚Äîinto a single, organized workspace, projects provide a cohesive view for efficient development and deployment.

</Frame>


This feature supports version control at the project level, allowing users to create and manage multiple versions and builds. Projects also facilitate resource sharing through dependencies, enabling the reuse of processes and configurations across projects. These enhancements make it easier to maintain project integrity, deploy updates seamlessly, and ensure consistency across environments. Here is a quick walkthrough demo:

#### Config vs build

* Config mode is the environment where you set up, adjust, and manage your project's resources, processes, and configurations. It's the workspace where you fine-tune every aspect of the project before it's ready for deployment. Think of it as the design phase, where the focus is on setup, organization, and preparation.
* Build mode is the stage where the configurations you've set up are packaged into a deployable form. This is the runtime-ready version of your project, containing everything needed for it to function in a production environment. A build includes a snapshot of the project‚Äôs state at a given point, ensuring stability and predictability when deployed.

### Integration Designer

The Integration Designer simplifies the integration of FlowX with external systems using REST APIs. It offers a user-friendly graphical interface with intuitive drag-and-drop functionality for defining data models, orchestrating workflows, and configuring system endpoints.

With Integration Designer, you can easily set up REST-based connections and define workflows, while enjoying flexible authorization options such as Service Token, Bearer, or No Auth.

<Tip>
**Did you know?**

Unlike [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), which focuses on API testing, the Integration Designer automates workflows between systems. With drag-and-drop ease, it handles REST API connections, real-time processes, and error management, making integrations seamless and scalable.

### Merge conflicts 2.0

The Merge Conflicts feature delivers an enhanced collaboration experience for managing branch versions, focusing on improving conflict detection, resolution efficiency, and seamless merging workflows.

#### Merging without conflicts

Easily merge secondary branches into the main branch or other branches when no conflicts are detected. The updated merge modal includes:

- A clean, streamlined interface for branch selection.
- A mandatory, validated commit message field (max 50 characters).
- Real-time feedback for successful merges and updates to the branching graph.

Resolve conflicts directly at the resource level with an intuitive interface:

- **JSON Comparisons:** Visualize differences with color-coded highlights (source: yellow, target: blue).
- **Navigation Support:** Quickly jump between differences for efficient resolution.
- **Progress Tracking:** Mark resources as ‚ÄúReviewed‚Äù or ‚ÄúSeen‚Äù to monitor resolution progress.

The Table component is a simple and flexible way to display data in web applications. It lets you customize columns, add pagination, sort and filter data, and apply your own styling. You can resize columns, scroll through data, and even add actions like editing or deleting rows directly in the table. It‚Äôs easy to set up, with default columns and rows generated automatically based on your data.

#### Conditional formatting for UI elements

Dynamically update styling and properties of UI elements based on conditions, reducing the need for multiple prototypes.

#### Hide expressions enhancements

Expanded hide expressions functionality to include:

- Cards
- Collection prototypes and children
- Table cell children (e.g., texts, images, buttons, links)

#### UI actions

* Added a new UI action **Start new project instance**
* Removed the **Start Process Inherit** UI action type.

#### UI action form updates

* Introduced **Functional** and **UX sections** for all action types, with a checkbox for **Add Analytics Name** in the UX section.
* Simplified custom and exclude key management.

### Start new project instance action

We‚Äôve introduced the Start New Project Instance node action, enabling users to initiate a completely new process from within an ongoing one. This functionality is perfect for scenarios where isolated use cases are managed across different applications or environments.

### Custom components validation

You are able to validate and retrieve data from a generated screen, including data from a custom form section. Additionally, you‚Äôll have the ability to trigger and manage data directly within that section. This will be a major benefit for clients who have chosen to create custom components for the entire screen (for example, a form that isn‚Äôt supported natively by the platform).




---

### Autocomputed data to send

In previous platform versions, when creating your UI screens and working with data, you had to ensure that all the data stored in your process keys was saved in the process instance. This required adding an extra parameter called "Data to send" to the "Save Data" node action.


**Older versions** vs **v4.6.0**:

<Frame>
<Frame><img height="200" alt="older versions" src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/4.x-aut.png"/> </Frame> <Frame> <img height="200" alt="v.4.6" src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/4.2-aut.png"/> </Frame>
</Frame>


Now, with the autocompute feature, this step is no longer necessary, as the data is automatically saved and sent on your process instance.


<Tip>

You no longer need to add "Save Data" node actions, but make sure to include "Forms to Validate" on the UI Actions. This helps ensure that data is submitted correctly and automatically activates any added validators where they exist.

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/forms_to_validate.png)
</Frame>
</Tip>

However, you still have the option to customize which keys are included or excluded as needed.

### Scripting UX improvements

We're excited to announce significant improvements to our scripting UX. These enhancements focus on upgrading the code editors and introducing an advanced autocomplete feature. Configurators, both experienced and novice, will benefit from better visual feedback, support for interpolation syntax, and integrated help and examples. 

The updates aim to streamline the configuration process, reduce errors, and make testing and troubleshooting more efficient.

#### Autocomplete based on data model

Autocomplete for attributes is now available, improving configuration efficiency by offering tailored suggestions based on data model attributes.

### Analytics integration for Container Apps

Container apps now support tracking "Screen Displayed" and "Action Executed" events, configurable in the UI Designer to improve insights into user interactions.

**UI Designer updates**

- **Analytics Screen Name:** Configurable under Root UI components (Cards and Containers) to enable tracking in analytics platforms like Google Analytics.

<Tip>  
  "Screen Displayed" events support user task-based reporting, such as when a user task screen is shown.  
</Tip>

<Frame>  
  ![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/Screenshot%202024-12-11%20at%2016.01.58.png)  
</Frame>  

<Info>  
  The configured values are stored in `flowxProps.analytics`, making them accessible for integration with analytics tools.  
</Info>  

- **Action Analytics:** Tracks user actions (e.g., button clicks) with tags set directly in the UI Action Form.

<Info>  
  Added analytics configuration in the **UX Section** for all UI action types.  
</Info>  

<Frame>

</Frame>  

<Info>  
  Values are saved in `params.analytics` via the PATCH `/actions` request.  
</Info>  

**Renderers updates**

Renderers now expose a public API for triggering analytics events:

- **Screen Events:** Triggered on user task display, using `flowxProps.analytics`.
- **Action Events:** Triggered on action execution, using `params.analytics`.

Dynamic values such as process store keys and replace tags are supported for more contextual tracking.
