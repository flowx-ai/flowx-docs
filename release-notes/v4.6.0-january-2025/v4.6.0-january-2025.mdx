### Merge Conflict Resolution

The Merge Conflicts feature delivers an enhanced collaboration experience for managing branch versions, focusing on improving conflict detection, resolution efficiency, and seamless merging workflows.

#### Merging Without Conflicts

Easily merge secondary branches into the main branch or other branches when no conflicts are detected. The updated merge modal includes:

- A clean, streamlined interface for branch selection.
- A mandatory, validated commit message field (max 50 characters).
- Real-time feedback for successful merges and updates to the branching graph.

#### Advanced Conflict Detection

The new **Conflicts Detected Modal** provides a detailed overview of conflicting changes, with features such as:

- Clear grouping by resource type (e.g., Processes, Enumerations, Media Library).
- Scrollable lists and clickable entries to resolve conflicts efficiently.
- A comprehensive comparison of source and target branch differences for context.

#### Resource-Level Conflict Resolution

Resolve conflicts directly at the resource level with an intuitive interface:

- **JSON Comparisons:** Visualize differences with color-coded highlights (source: yellow, target: blue).
- **Navigation Support:** Quickly jump between differences for efficient resolution.
- **Progress Tracking:** Mark resources as ‚ÄúReviewed‚Äù or ‚ÄúSeen‚Äù to monitor resolution progress.
