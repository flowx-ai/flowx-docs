# v3.4.1-September 2023 (Patch Release)

Welcome to the FLOWX.AI v3.4.1 patch release! In this update, we've fine-tuned your FLOWX.AI experience with fixes and enhancements. While it may not be a major version update, it's packed with valuable improvements.

## **What's new**

### Scheduler Configuration

* We've introduced a new configuration for the Scheduler microservice. Learn more in our [<u>**deployment guidelines**</u>](./deployment-guidelines-v3.4.1.md#scheduler-configuration).


## **Bug Fixes** üîß

### Timer Events

* **Fixed Timer Events Shyness**

    - We've given our timer events a little nudge, and they will now reliably appear on the canvas after refreshing the page.

* **Resolved Mandatory Fields Error Messages**

    - Our system has become more serious about mandatory fields and will now consistently display error messages when required fields are empty.

* **Improved Timer Expression Validators**

    -  We've implemented validators for timer expressions, ensuring they follow the rules as expected.

* **Fixed Timer Events in Read-Only Process Versions**

    - Timer events will now behave appropriately and disable their fields in read-only process versions.

### Versioning 

* **Enhanced Versioning System** 

    -  We've made significant improvements to the versioning system to resolve these issues. Branch merging and UUID handling have been optimized, and the branching graph now consistently appears during import/export operations.

### Swimlane allocation

* **Removed Lingering UI After Process Definition Deletion**

    - We've cleared away this lingering UI, so you won't encounter remnants of deleted process definitions in the swimlane allocation interface anymore.



### Revised Cache Key Organization

* Check the deployment guidelines for more information:

[Revised Cache Key Organization](deployment-guidelines-v3.4.1.md#revised-cache-key-organization)

### Other Bits

* Bid farewell to the autoarrange function in the [**Process Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer).

## **Gremlins to Watch Out For** üôÅ

Keep an eye out for these quirks:

* **Slider UI element**: Our slider component can be a bit mysterious at times. Currently, it enjoys a game of hide-and-seek with the correct value when sourced from process data.
* **Document preview UI element**: Our document preview component has a unique sense of style. It prefers to take up only a portion of the screen, even when told to "fill" the entire width. It's a rebel with a cause.
* **Business rules**: Our business rule have a language barrier, but they're working on it. Changing the language of a business rule doesn't always lead to using the new language for execution. It's like they have a favorite phrase they won't let go of.
* **Process Designer**: Deleting a boundary node in the process designer and coming back from the UI Designer doesn't always clean up the associated sequence from the boundary event. It's like they left a party and forgot their hat.
