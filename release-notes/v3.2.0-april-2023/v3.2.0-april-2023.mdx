So, what are you waiting for? Grab a snack, sit back, and get ready to explore the newest version of **FLOWX.AI**.

## **New features** üÜï

### UI Designer ‚úçÔ∏è

New features for the UI Designer:

#### Segmented button

Added a new type of button - **segmented button**. It allows users to pick only one option from a group of options, and you can choose to have between 2 and 5 options in the group. The segmented button is easy to use, and can help make your application easier for people to use.

#### Shadows

The new shadow feature is a visual effect that creates a sense of depth and dimensionality in UI designer elements.

The shadow option can be customized to suit the overall design aesthetic of the interface, with properties for shadow color, opacity, blur and distance from the element. It can be applied to a range of UI elements, including [root elements](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/root-components), forms, [collections](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/collection), [buttons](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/buttons), messages, [images](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/image) and [file preview](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/file-preview).

#### Disable button - add disabled condition

A new feature has been added that allows a button to be disabled in cases where custom form validations are applied. The user can set a disabled condition for the button element, and the button will remain disabled until the validation criteria are met.

### Platform

#### Set client and environment

The Designer app now allows users to set the client and environment through the **Platform Status** tab. In cases where these are not configured, a modal will be displayed on the Flowx instance, and the user will be required to enter the necessary information before accessing any other section.

If the user lacks the required authorization, a separate modal will be prompted.

### Process designer

#### Floating menu

Added a floating menu with multiple actions, including "Home", "View instance data", "Process definition", and "Info". The menu will be visible during error or loading states, with toast error displayed over it and the menu displayed above during loading states:

* the "View instance data" action opens a process instance view that overlays the rendered interface
* the "Process definition" action opens the process definition in the same tab, displaying the same version that was run 
* the "Info" action displays a card with process definition info and instance start and end

### Content Management

#### CMS audit log

Added audit options for the CMS system. It keeps track of changes made to different parts of the CMS, like [Enumerations](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/core-extensions/content-management/enumerations), [Substitution Tags](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/core-extensions/content-management/substitution-tags), [Languages](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/core-extensions/content-management/languages), [Source Systems](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/core-extensions/content-management/source-systems), and [Media Library](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/core-extensions/content-management/media-library). 

Whether you need to troubleshoot an error or are just interested in keeping a close eye on changes, the audit log is a useful tool for monitoring and debugging
