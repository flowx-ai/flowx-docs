title: Migrating from v4.1.x to v4.6.0
description: This document outlines the configuration and infrastructure changes introduced from v4.1.x to v4.5.3 for deploying the FlowX.AI platform.
---


## 4.5.0 changes

### CMS Setup

#### MongoDB configuration

In version 4.5.0, the CMS setup includes a more comprehensive MongoDB configuration, especially for runtime data handling:

- **Runtime MongoDB Instance**: A dedicated MongoDB instance for managing runtime data.
  - **New Environment Variables**:
    - `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_RUNTIME_ENABLED`: Enables runtime MongoDB usage. Default is `true`.
    - `RUNTIME_DB_USERNAME`: Username for runtime MongoDB access.
    - `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_RUNTIME_URI`: Connection URI for the runtime MongoDB instance.
    - `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_STORAGE`: Specifies storage type for Azure environments (`mongodb` or `cosmosdb`). Default is `mongodb`.
  - **Transaction Settings for Mongock Library**:
    - `MONGOCK_TRANSACTIONENABLED`: Controls MongoDB transaction support with Mongock, defaulting to `false` due to compatibility concerns with MongoDB 5.

---

### Admin setup

#### MongoDB configuration

Version 4.5.0 introduces a new MongoDB setup in the Admin service for managing data model information:

- **New MongoDB Data Model Configuration**:
  - **Environment Variables**:
    - `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI`: URI for connecting to the MongoDB data model instance.
    - `DB_USERNAME`: Set to `data-model` for data model access.
    - `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_STORAGE`: Specifies storage type for Azure environments (`mongodb` or `cosmosdb`).

### Engine setup

#### MongoDB configuration

The Engine configuration now includes additional setup for a runtime MongoDB instance to manage runtime builds:
- **Runtime MongoDB for Engine**:
  - **New Environment Variables**:
    - `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_RUNTIME_ENABLED`: Enables runtime MongoDB access. Default is `true`.
    - `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_RUNTIME_URI`: URI for connecting to the runtime MongoDB.
    - `DB_USERNAME`: Set to `app-runtime` for runtime data access.

## 4.5.1 changes

In the 4.5.1 release, a new configuration option has been added to the Integration Designer for enhanced Kafka topic management.

* **New Configuration**: `FLOWX_WORKFLOW_CREATETOPICS`

    * **When set to true**: In development environments, where Kafka topics may need to be created automatically, this configuration can be enabled (flowx.workflow.createTopics: true). This allows for the automatic creation of "in" and "out" topics when workflows are created, eliminating the need to wait for topic creation at runtime.
    * **Default setting (false)**: In production or controlled environments, where automated topic creation is not desired, this setting remains false to prevent unintended Kafka topic creation.

This update aims to streamline the development process by enabling faster setup of workflows with automatic Kafka topic creation in designated environments.

### Update default application

If you have already updated to **4.5.0** or **4.5.1**, ensure that you create at least one new version of the `default_application`(where all the process definitions from previous versions are migrated). This step verifies that your default application remains up to date with the latest changes:

1. Open the `default_application` in the UI.
2. Check for a **new version** (either draft or committed).
3. Ensure that there is a new version compared to the **committed version** that was automatically created during the migration from Release 4.5.0.
4. Save or commit a new version if necessary.

This step ensures your application configurations are aligned with the latest migration requirements.

## 4.5.3 changes

### Update default application

If you have already updated to **4.5.0** or **4.5.3**, ensure that you create at least one new version of the `default_application`(where all the process definitions from previous versions are migrated). This step verifies that your default application remains up to date with the latest changes:

1. Open the `default_application` in the UI.
2. Check for a **new version** (either draft or committed).
3. Ensure that there is a new version compared to the **committed version** that was automatically created during the migration from Release 4.5.0.
4. Save or commit a new version if necessary.

This step ensures your application configurations are aligned with the latest migration requirements.

### Documents and notifications templates setup guides

#### Runtime database integration

Both Notifications and Documents services now seamlessly connect to the runtime database.

Add the following environment variables:

- `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_RUNTIME_ENABLED` - Enables Runtime MongoDB usage (default value: `true`)
- `RUNTIME_DB_USERNAME`: `app-runtime`
- `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_RUNTIME_URI` - URI for connecting to the Runtime MongoDB instance - `app-runtime`
- `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_STORAGE` - Specifies the storage type used for the Runtime MongoDB instance (Azure environments only) 
  - **Possible Values:** `mongodb`, `cosmosdb`
  - **Default Value:** `mongodb`

#### Data-sync service enhancements

Two new migrations added to the data-sync service.

Requires connectivity with Notifications and Documents databases for proper operation:

- `NOTIFICATIONPLUGIN_MONGO_USERNAME`: `mongodb-username` -> Represents the username for authenticating to the MongoDB database used by the Notifications Plugin.
- `NOTIFICATIONPLUGIN_MONGO_PASSWORD`: `mongodb-password` -> Represents the password associated with the `NOTIFICATIONPLUGIN_MONGO_USERNAME` for database access.

- `DOCUMENTPLUGIN_MONGO_USERNAME`: `mongodb-username` -> Represents the username for authenticating to the MongoDB database used by the Documents Plugin.
- `DOCUMENTPLUGIN_MONGO_PASSWORD`: `mongodb-password` -> Represents the password associated with the `DOCUMENTPLUGIN_MONGO_USERNAME` for database access.


- `FLOWX_DATASOURCE_DOCUMENTPLUGIN_URI`: Specifies the connection details for the MongoDB database used by the Documents Plugin.
- `FLOWX_DATASOURCE_NOTIFICATIONPLUGIN_URI`: Specifies the connection details for the MongoDB database used by the Notifications Plugin.
