## Dependencies

### Project-to-library dependencies

<Info>
FlowX 5.0 maintains **full backwards compatibility** with existing project-to-library dependencies from FlowX 4.x. All existing project-to-library dependencies will continue to work without modification.
</Info>


### Upgrade considerations

When upgrading to FlowX 5.0:

1. **Existing dependencies** will be automatically migrated
2. **New library dependency features** become available immediately
3. **No breaking changes** to existing functionality
4. **Enhanced validation** may catch previously undetected issues

### Post-migration requirements

<Warning> 
**Cache Clearing Required**: After the lib2lib migration is executed, you must clear the cache. This is necessary because a new field is added to the build mongo document, which is required for various operations. 
</Warning>

Steps to clear cache:

1. Complete the lib2lib migration process
2. Clear the application cache to ensure the new build document fields are properly recognized
3. Verify that library-to-library dependencies are functioning correctly
