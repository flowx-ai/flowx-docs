## Dependencies

### Project-to-Library Dependencies

<Info>
FlowX 5.0 maintains **full backwards compatibility** with existing project-to-library dependencies from FlowX 4.x. All existing project-to-library dependencies will continue to work without modification.
</Info>


### Upgrade Considerations

When upgrading to FlowX 5.0:

1. **Existing dependencies** will be automatically migrated
2. **New library dependency features** become available immediately
3. **No breaking changes** to existing functionality
4. **Enhanced validation** may catch previously undetected issues
