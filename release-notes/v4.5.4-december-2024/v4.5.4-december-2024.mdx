## What's new? üÜï

### Integration designer updates

- **Testing on Upper Environments**: Users can now test endpoints and workflows in upper environments with customizable configurations and detailed runtime logs, ensuring smooth and accurate testing.
- **System Enumeration Toggle**: Added a toggle to manage system enumeration mapping:  
  - Turning it ON includes the system in the enumeration table and enables the Enum Mapper.  
  - Turning it OFF removes the system, disables related mappings, and clears existing data with a warning.  
- **Duplicate Workflow & Endpoint**: A new "Duplicate" option streamlines the creation of similar workflows or endpoints, supporting renaming, optional descriptions, and independent modifications. Success or error notifications ensure clarity during the duplication process.  
- **Testing on Committed Versions**: Enables testing of endpoints and workflows on committed versions with editable inputs, detailed logs, and response previews in modals tailored to the selected version.  
- **Enum Translation in Lists**: Expanded support for enum translation in lists of objects and arrays of enums, with simplified and efficient JSON path formatting.  
- **Multiple Incoming Sequences**: Workflow nodes now support multiple incoming sequences, allowing for complex designs where conditions or actions converge. 
- **Rename Workflow Nodes**: Introduced in-place editing for workflow node names, with validations to ensure uniqueness and compliance with naming rules.  
- **Start/Call Subworkflow Node (Sync)**: Added a new node with the ability to reuse predefined workflows (local or library) within parent workflows. Subworkflows complete before proceeding and halt the parent workflow on failure.  
- **Configurable Timeout & Retry**: Endpoint nodes now allow configurable timeouts (default: 10,000 ms) and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, ensuring resilience during API interactions.
- **Missing Sequence Alerts**: Workflow nodes with unmapped branches now display a yellow warning icon and provide actionable guidance for resolution.

### AI agents

### Analytics integration for container apps

<Warning>
This feature is compatible with the new Angular packages, scheduled for release in v4.5.5.
</Warning>

Container apps now support tracking "Screen Displayed" and "Action Executed" events, configurable in the UI Designer to improve insights into user interactions.

**UI Designer updates**:

* **Analytics Screen Name**: Configurable under Root UI components (Cards and Containers) to enable tracking in analytics platforms like Google Analytics.  


<Tip>
"Screen Displayed" events support user task-based reporting, such as when a user task screen is shown.

**Renderers updates**:

Renderers now expose a public API for triggering analytics events:

- **Screen Events**: Triggered on user task display, using `flowxProps.analytics`.
- **Action Events**: Triggered on action execution, using `params.analyticcs`.

Dynamic values such as process store keys and replace tags are supported for more contextual tracking.
