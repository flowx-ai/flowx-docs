## Merge conflicts - workflow improvements

### Enhanced workflow conflict resolution

We've significantly improved how [**workflow**](../../4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/integrations/integration-designer#workflows) conflicts are handled in this release:

- Upgraded to a new version (v2) of the workflow conflict resolution interface
- Now only showing workflow entities that have actual conflicts, making it easier to identify and address issues
- Streamlined the conflict resolution process for a more efficient workflow

<Info>
**Important note about sequence conflicts:**

When resolving conflicts related to sequences, if you select one of the conflicting sequences, nodes that are no longer connected may remain "orphaned" on the canvas in the merged version. This design decision was made to prevent accidental node deletion. If these orphaned nodes are no longer needed, they can be manually removed in subsequent versions.
</Info>
 

## Configurable enumeration ordering

You can now configure the **Order** attribute on enumerations, giving you greater control over how enumeration values are displayed in dropdown lists:

- Set specific order values for each enumeration entry
- Control the presentation sequence in UI components
- Improve user experience by arranging options in logical or prioritized order

<Info>
**Limitation:** When changing the order value for an enumeration entry, the system does not automatically update the order values of other entries. You'll need to manually adjust the order values of other entries in the interface.

- Fixed an issue where workflow nodes could have two output sequences 
- Resolved a problem with enumerations displaying in the wrong order in dropdown lists
- Fixed an authentication issue where users would receive 401 unauthorized errors when executing actions after token refresh
- Fixed a UI behavior issue where slider actions configured with "onChange" were incorrectly triggered when entering a screen instead of only when modified 
- Resolved intermittent application build export timeouts that were occurring for projects with library dependencies
- Fixed an issue with identical advancing IDs occurring in multi-pod deployments due to missing hostname command in GraalVM docker images
- Resolved an issue preventing media library migration from default application
- Fixed the "Go to reference" functionality from data model attributes that was not correctly redirecting to referenced elements 
- Fixed an error during application export/import where "There already exists a tagged build for this project version" was preventing successful imports 
- Restored support for multiple topics in Data Stream Topics feature, which was previously only listening to the first topic in the list
- Fixed a 500 error that occurred when attempting to create child actions on certain nodes
- Fixed a critical issue where UI templates would disappear when creating a new version of an application after performing undo operations on pasted templates 
- Fixed a bug where updates to the subprocess in a Start subprocess action weren't being saved properly
- Fixed an issue with the "Send email" button remaining disabled in the Test notification template feature after correcting validation errors
- Fixed an error that occurred when trying to export document templates containing null values in templateMap
- Fixed a display issue where Tokens, Workflows, and Subprocesses information wasn't showing in process instances after migration from 4.7.1 to 4.7.2
