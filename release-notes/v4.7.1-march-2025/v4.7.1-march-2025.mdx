## Projects

### Enhanced resource usage navigation

We've significantly improved how you navigate between resources and their references with direct navigation capabilities. Now you can easily jump from the usage tracking panel to the exact location where a resource is referenced.

  <Card title="3x Faster Execution" icon="bolt">  
  Python scripts now run at least 3 times faster than with Python 2.7.
  </Card>  
  <Card title="Modern Python Features" icon="code">  
  Take advantage of Python 3's improved syntax, libraries, and security features.
  </Card>  
</CardGroup>

<Info>
**Important Configuration Note:** Python 2.7 remains the default runtime. To enable Python 3 support with its performance improvements, you must set the feature toggle `FLOWX_SCRIPTENGINE_USEGRAALVM` to `true` in the [**Process Engine configuration**](/4.7.x/setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup) and in the **AI Developer** (if used) agent configuration. If this configuration variable is missing or set to `false`, Python 2.7 will be used.
</Info>


More details about the scripting capabilities can be found in the [Supported scripting languages](../../4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/supported-scripts) section.

## Performance improvements 🚀

We've made significant performance enhancements throughout the platform to make your development and runtime experience smoother and faster.

### Design time improvements

For large processes, you'll notice dramatic improvements:

| Operation         | Improvement    |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Cloning a process | **5x faster**  |
| Opening a process | **70x faster** |

### Runtime enhancements

Platform average response time has been **reduced by 20%** in our comprehensive benchmark*.

<Info>
*The benchmark simulates a typical business process with a combination of user and service tasks. It includes rules that automate decision-making, as well as events for time-sensitive actions and communication. The process also covers various system functions, ensuring the platform can efficiently manage complex workflows with both individual and parallel tasks.
