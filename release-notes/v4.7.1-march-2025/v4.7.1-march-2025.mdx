title: FlowX.AI 4.7.1 Release Notes
description: FlowX.AI 4.7.1 brings enhanced resource navigation, better error detection, and workflow improvements to make your development journey even smoother! 🚀
---

## What's new? 🆕

✅ Enhanced resource usage tracking with direct navigation  
✅ Upgraded JavaScript support to ECMAScript 15 (2024) in Business Rules  
✅ Added Python 3 support with 3x performance improvement  
✅ Major performance enhancements for both design time and runtime        
✅ Security enhancements for runtime endpoints


## Projects

### Enhanced resource usage navigation

We've significantly improved how you navigate between resources and their references with direct navigation capabilities. Now you can easily jump from the usage tracking panel to the exact location where a resource is referenced.

<Tabs>  
<Tab title="How it works">  
1️⃣ **Access resource usage** – View where a resource is being used through the usage panel.  
2️⃣ **One-click navigation** – Use the new redirect button to jump directly to the referenced location.  
3️⃣ **Missing resource detection** – Easily identify and fix missing resource references with clear indicators.  
</Tab>  
<Tab title="Why it's better">  
- **Faster troubleshooting** – Directly navigate to problem areas without manual searching.  
- **Improved productivity** – Less time spent hunting down references means more time building.  
- **Better error prevention** – Quickly spot and fix missing resources before they cause issues.

## Enhanced scripting capabilities

### ECMAScript 15 (2024) support for Business Rules

FlowX.AI 4.7.1 brings the latest JavaScript features to your business rules with an upgrade to ECMAScript 15 (2024).

<Tabs>  
<Tab title="What's included">  
- Access to the latest JavaScript language features
- Modern syntax for cleaner, more maintainable rules
- Enhanced tooling and IDE support
</Tab>  
<Tab title="Benefits">  
- Write more concise and expressive business rules
- Leverage modern JavaScript patterns and best practices
- Improved developer experience with better IDE integration
</Tab>  
</Tabs>

<Info>
**Important Configuration Note:** Nashorn engine remains the default runtime. To enable GraalJS support with its performance improvements, you must set the feature toggle `FLOWX_SCRIPTENGINE_USEGRAALVM` to `true` in the [**Process Engine configuration**](/4.7.x/setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup) and in the **AI Developer** (if used) agent configuration. If this configuration variable is missing or set to `false`, Nashorn will be used.
</Info>

### Python 3 support for Business Rules

We've upgraded our Python scripting capabilities to Python 3, delivering significant performance improvements while maintaining compatibility.

<CardGroup columns="2">
  <Card title="3x Faster Execution" icon="bolt">  
  Python scripts now run at least 3 times faster than with Python 2.7.
  </Card>  
  <Card title="Modern Python Features" icon="code">  
  Take advantage of Python 3's improved syntax, libraries, and security features.
  </Card>  
</CardGroup>

<Info>
**Important Configuration Note:** Python 2.7 remains the default runtime. To enable Python 3 support with its performance improvements, you must set the feature toggle `FLOWX_SCRIPTENGINE_USEGRAALVM` to `true` in the [**Process Engine configuration**](/4.7.x/setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup) and in the **AI Developer** (if used) agent configuration. If this configuration variable is missing or set to `false`, Python 2.7 will be used.

## Performance improvements 🚀


We've made significant performance enhancements throughout the platform to make your development and runtime experience smoother and faster.

### Design time improvements

For large processes, you'll notice dramatic improvements:

| Operation         | Improvement    |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Cloning a process | **5x faster**  |
| Opening a process | **70x faster** |

### Runtime enhancements

Platform average response time has been **reduced by 20%** in our comprehensive benchmark*.

<Info>
*The benchmark simulates a typical business process with a combination of user and service tasks. It includes rules that automate decision-making, as well as events for time-sensitive actions and communication. The process also covers various system functions, ensuring the platform can efficiently manage complex workflows with both individual and parallel tasks.

## Security enhancements 🔒

We've significantly improved platform security by implementing proper endpoint access controls and separation between internal and public-facing APIs.

<CardGroup columns="2">
  <Card title="Enhanced API Security" icon="shield-check">  
  Runtime execution proxy vulnerability addressed with comprehensive endpoint updates.
  </Card>  
  <Card title="Access Control Improvements" icon="lock">  
  Better separation between design-time and runtime endpoints with proper access controls.
  </Card>  
</CardGroup>

### Endpoint security updates

We've implemented a comprehensive security update for runtime endpoints to prevent potential proxy vulnerabilities:

- Redesigned API structure to separate internal (`runtime-internal`) from external-facing (`runtime`) endpoints
- Migrated design-time operations to use `runtime-internal` endpoints for enhanced security
- Moved specific management operations to dedicated `build-mgmt` endpoints 
- Updated all API clients to use the new secure endpoints

<Info>
**Important:** Make sure to update to the corresponding  version of the [**`flowx-admin`**](./deployment-guidelines-v4.7.1#component-versions) to benefit from these security enhancements.
