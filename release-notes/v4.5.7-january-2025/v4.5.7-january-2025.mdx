### New runtime manager service account

As of **FlowX.AI 4.5.7**, we have introduced a **new runtime manager service account** in Keycloak. This account is required for several key operations including:

1. **Export/Import of builds and application versions**  
2. **Managing scheduled events when transitioning from one build to another**  
3. **Performing requests from the application manager or runtime manager to other resource services**  

<Info>
If you encounter errors during export/import of builds or application versions, verify that the `flowx-runtime-manager-sa` service account exists in Keycloak and has the correct **service account roles** assigned. This same service account is leveraged across multiple modules to ensure secure and seamless communication with Keycloak.
