title: FlowX.AI 4.7.2 Release Notes
description: FlowX.AI 4.7.2 brings enhanced resource navigation, better error detection, and workflow improvements to make your development journey even smoother! 🚀
---

## **What's new? 🆕**

✅ Improved merge conflict handling with retry functionality          
✅ Enhanced error messages during failed merges           
✅ Streamlined workflow for resolving merge conflicts             

## Merge conflicts

### Improved error messages when merge fails

We've enhanced the merge conflict resolution experience with more informative error messages and a new retry functionality:

- When a merge fails, users can now see a "Retry merge" button on the Merge failed modal
- Clicking this button allows users to attempt the merge again without losing previous work

The system now handles two distinct scenarios:

**1. When conflicts exist:**
- The system opens the Merge conflicts panel with the previous state of the merge before the failed attempt
- This preserves all your conflict resolution work so you can fix the specific issues that caused the failure

**2. When no conflicts exist:**
- The system automatically retries the merge operation
- This streamlines the workflow when the merge failure was due to temporary issues rather than actual conflicts

## Process engine

### Deprecated DMN rules

In version 4.7.2, we've deprecated the [[**DMN (Decision Model and Notation)**]](../../4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/actions/business-rule-action/dmn-business-rule-action) business rule actions. This change affects how business rules are configured on task/user task nodes in business processes.

**What's changing:**
- DMN is no longer available as a language option when configuring business rule actions

**What's next:**
For guidance on using alternative business rule languages, please refer to our [supported scripting languages](../../4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/supported-scripts) documentation.
