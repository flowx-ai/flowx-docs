In this release, we've added a some cool new stuff and also some enhancements to previously mind-blowing v4.0!

Let's dive in and explore:

## **What's New?** üÜï

### Misconfigurations

The Misconfigurations Warnings feature introduces a proactive alert system that ensures alignment between process configurations and selected platforms.

With dynamic platform-specific settings, users receive alerts that guide them toward optimal configurations for navigation and UI design. These alerts, integrated into the frontend interface, empower users to make informed decisions, thereby enhancing the process configuration.

An additional step is required to compute and enable misconfigurations in existing processes from older releases:

### Navigation areas - navigation inside zones and pages

We're enhancing navigation within zones and pages to enable a step-by-step or wizard-style experience. 

In the Navigation Panel, a new option will be available exclusively for the web platform. Users can choose between "Single Page Form," which displays all tasks in the same zone, and "Wizard," presenting tasks one at a time with custom navigation buttons.

### Static document management via CMS

Decoupled static document management from the Document Plugin, enabling independent management of documents such as terms and conditions, rules and regulations, and brochures.

The changes involve enhancing the platform's capabilities for managing static documents, particularly PDFs, within the media library. This includes enabling the upload of PDF files, updating information text to reflect PDF format specifications.

<Info>
With the introduction of the Media Library's static document management feature, the previous method of utilizing paths within the **Process Data** for **File Preview** component to display static documents will be phased out.

You can still use it if you have scenarios in which you need to [**generate templates from HTML**](../../4.0/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/documents-plugin/generating-from-html-templates) and then display them in a file preview.

### Theme Management

We've introduced preview options for more UI components. Now, you can review changes in the theming configurations before finalizing them.

### Tracing - open telemetry

In our 4.1 release, we're thrilled to introduce tracing with Open Telemetry with additional FlowX custom span attributes, offering enhanced visibility and insights into application behavior. With its capabilities, users can pinpoint issues and optimize performance. 

Consequently, we'll be phasing out Jaeger tracing to focus on the advanced features and broader support of Open Telemetry, ensuring a smooth transition.

For traces visualization, use tools like Grafana to filter and search spans based on custom attributes like `fx.processInstanceUuid`, `fx.nodeName`, `fx.actionName`, and others. This helps in pinpointing specific operations or issues within a trace.

## **Changes**  üîß

- **Process Designer**: The "Start Subprocess" functionality on Service Task nodes has been discontinued.
- **UI Components**: Introduced the inclusion of a `data test id` within the `Settings > Generic` tab across all UI components, facilitating seamless identification and interaction with UI elements during automated testing.

## **Bug Fixes** üõ†Ô∏è

We've also squashed pesky bugs to ensure a smoother and more reliable experience across the board.

## Gremlins to Watch Out For

Keep an eye out for these quirks:

- Versioning: Merging branches without importing the latest committed version may result in a surprise merge conflict party. We're on it! 
- UI Designer: When relocating UI elements between parents, the elements' order doesn't always get the memo, causing a mix-up in the family tree. We're untangling this knot!
