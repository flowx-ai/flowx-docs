title: FlowX.AI 4.1 release üöÄ
description: üéâ Welcome to the FlowX.AI 4.1 release!
---


In this release, we've added some cool new features and enhancements to our already mind-blowing v4.0!! Let's dive in and explore:

## **What's New?** üÜï

### Misconfigurations

The Misconfigurations Warnings feature introduces a proactive alert system that ensures alignment between process configurations and selected platforms.

With dynamic platform-specific settings, users receive alerts that guide them toward optimal configurations for navigation and UI design. These alerts, integrated into the frontend interface, empower users to make informed decisions, thereby enhancing the process configuration.

An additional step is required to compute and enable misconfigurations in existing processes from older releases:

### Navigation areas - navigation inside zones and pages

We're enhancing navigation within zones and pages to enable a step-by-step or wizard-style experience. 

In the Navigation Panel, a new option will be available exclusively for the web platform. Users can choose between "Single Page Form," which displays all tasks in the same zone (in parallel), and "Wizard," presenting tasks one at a time with custom navigation buttons.

### Static document management via CMS

Decoupled static document management from the Document Plugin, enabling independent management of documents such as terms and conditions, rules and regulations, and brochures.

The changes involve enhancing the platform's capabilities for managing static documents, particularly PDFs, within the media library. This includes enabling the upload of PDF files, updating information text to reflect PDF format specifications.

<Info>
With the introduction of the Media Library's static document management feature, the previous method of utilizing paths within the **Process Data** for **File Preview** component to display static documents will be phased out.

You can still use it if you have scenarios in which you need to [**generate templates from HTML**](../../4.0/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/documents-plugin/generating-from-html-templates) and then display them in a file preview.
</Info>

### Dismiss navigation on secondary token end

When a navigation sequence is initiated by a secondary token triggered by a boundary event, it will automatically be dismissed when the token reaches the stop process event. This feature ensures that informative modals are closed without requiring extra configurations.

### Theme Management

We've introduced preview options for more UI components. Now, you can review changes in the theming configurations before finalizing them.

### Tracing - open telemetry

In our 4.1 release, we're thrilled to introduce tracing with Open Telemetry with additional FlowX custom span attributes, offering enhanced visibility and insights into application behavior. With its capabilities, users can pinpoint issues and optimize performance. 

Consequently, we'll be phasing out Jaeger tracing to focus on the advanced features and broader support of Open Telemetry, ensuring a smooth transition.

For traces visualization, use tools like Grafana to filter and search spans based on custom attributes like `fx.processInstanceUuid`, `fx.nodeName`, `fx.actionName`, and others. This helps in pinpointing specific operations or issues within a trace.

### Spring Boot upgrade

In 4.1 release, we upgraded to Spring Boot v3.2.x, the latest version of our microservices framework. This release brings significant improvements in performance, new features, and important bug fixes, enhancing the stability and functionality of your applications.

## **Changes**  üîß

- **Process Designer**: The "Start Subprocess" functionality on Service Task nodes has been discontinued.
- **UI Designer**: Introduced the inclusion of a `data test id` within the `Settings > Generic` tab across all UI components, facilitating seamless identification and interaction with UI elements during automated testing.

## **Bug Fixes** üõ†Ô∏è

We've also squashed pesky bugs to ensure a smoother and more reliable experience across the board.

- **Process Designer**: The error hiccups with embedded subprocesses and their error events have been smoothed out! No more getting stuck in a loop; now, you'll gracefully proceed to the embedded subprocess as expected.
- **Process Designer**: The versioning hiccup causing merge conflicts when trying to merge a branch with a main branch that wasn't imported into the environment has been fixed!
- **UI Designer**: The slider UI element's identity crisis has been resolved. No longer will it confuse its maximum value with its minimum counterpart.
- **UI Designer**: Concatenation glitch in text elements, where values from the collection prototype play hide and seek, has been patched up! No more disappearing acts - they'll be displayed side by side as intended.
- **UI Designer**: The glitch preventing the assignment of actions in button UI Actions with blank spaces in their names has been smoothed out!

## Gremlins to Watch Out For

Keep an eye out for these quirks:

- **UI Designer**: When relocating UI elements between parents, the elements' order doesn't always get the memo, causing a mix-up in the family tree. We're untangling this knot!
