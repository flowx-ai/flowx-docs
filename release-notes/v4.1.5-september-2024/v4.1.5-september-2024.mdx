<Info> 
This release is part of the long-term support (LTS) for version 4.1. While it’s a minor patch, we’ve focused on enhancing your security and overall experience with important fixes and updates.

## Fixes 🛠️

* **UI templates - generic properties**: UI templates with generic properties (e.g., labels) were being overridden by platform-specific settings upon process start, causing unexpected changes. This override issue has been resolved—generic properties will now stay as configured.
* **Undo/redo (Windows)**: We’ve reminded the **Ctrl** key that it’s not the “Undo!” button, and it now behaves like a respectable key should. You can once again Copy, Paste, and Select All without your inputs mysteriously disappearing and reappearing.
