Welcome to FLowX.AI 4.1.3 release. Let’s dive in and explore:


## Bug fixes 🛠️

### Process Designer

* **Copy/Paste Nodes**: Got a little too click-happy with those keyboard shortcuts in the Process Designer? You might have noticed multiple requests flooding in when you just wanted one. We’ve had a chat with the system, and it’s agreed to calm down. Now, one copy-paste equals one request. As it should be. ✂️📋
* **Stuck Nodes and Stubborn Swimlanes**: Tried to move a node or resize a swimlane after pasting and found everything frozen? The Process Designer had a little too much coffee. We’ve calmed it down, so now you can move and resize as you please. No more stuck nodes or swimlane stand-offs!

### FlowX.AI Engine

* **Business Rule Roulette**: Running the same business rule twice and getting different outcomes? That's not how it's supposed to work! We’ve put a stop to this for you. Now, your business rules run smooth and steady, just like you’d expect. 🎰🎯

## Gremlins to watch out for  👀

Keep an eye out for these quirks:

- **UI Designer**: When relocating UI elements between parents, the elements' order doesn't always get the memo, causing a mix-up in the family tree. We're untangling this knot!
