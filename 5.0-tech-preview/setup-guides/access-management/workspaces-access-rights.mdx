<Info>
FlowX 5.0 introduces a comprehensive role-based access control system with predefined roles at organization, workspace, and project levels.
</Info>

## Overview of workspaces access rights

FlowX 5.0 provides a structured role hierarchy designed to support multi-tenant workspace architecture while maintaining security and governance. The system includes predefined roles that cannot be modified, ensuring consistent access patterns across all FlowX deployments.

    All predefined roles are protected from deletion to ensure system consistency and security. This prevents accidental removal of critical access controls.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cannot Be Fundamentally Modified" icon="lock">
    Core permission structures of predefined roles cannot be altered. This ensures consistent behavior across all FlowX deployments and prevents security vulnerabilities.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Duplication Rules" icon="copy">
    Some roles can be duplicated to create custom variations:
    - **Can duplicate**: `workspace_user`, `theme_editor`, `project_editor`, `project_viewer`
    - **Cannot duplicate**: `org_admin`, `workspace_admin`, `project_owner`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Assignment Restrictions" icon="user-plus">

## Migration from FlowX 4.x

### Role mapping guide

<Warning>
FlowX 4.x roles stored in Keycloak are not automatically migrated. Manual role assignment is required.
</Warning>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Legacy Role Mapping" icon="arrow-right">
    **FlowX 4.x** → **FlowX 5.0**
    
    - `FLOWX_ADMIN` → `workspace_admin`
    - `FLOWX_CONFIGURATOR` → `workspace_user` or `project_editor`
    - `FLOWX_UI_DESIGNER` → `theme_editor`
    - `FLOWX_VIEWER` → `project_viewer`
    - Custom Keycloak roles → Manual review required
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Migration Considerations" icon="lightbulb">
    **Important Changes**
    
    - Roles are now workspace-scoped
    - More granular permission structure
    - Database-stored instead of token-based
    - New role hierarchy requires review
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Migration process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Inventory Current Roles">
    Document all existing Keycloak roles and their assigned users before migration
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Map to New Structure">
    Determine appropriate FlowX 5.0 roles for each user based on their current access needs
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Plan Workspace Structure">
    Decide how to organize users into workspaces based on business requirements
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assign New Roles">
    Use the FlowX 5.0 interface to assign appropriate roles to users in their respective workspaces
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Validate Access">
    Test user access to ensure proper permissions are granted and restrictions are enforced
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best practices

### Role assignment strategy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Principle of Least Privilege" icon="shield-check">
    **Always start with the minimum required access**
    
    - Begin with `project_viewer` for new users
    - Upgrade to `project_editor` only when needed
    - Reserve `workspace_admin` for actual administrators
    - Limit `org_admin` to platform administrators
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Groups for Scale" icon="users">
    **Leverage groups for efficient management**
    
    - Create groups for teams, departments, or functions
    - Assign roles to groups rather than individuals
    - Use the default "Everyone in workspace" group for common access
    - Document group purposes and membership criteria
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Regular Access Reviews" icon="calendar-check">
    **Implement periodic access auditing**
    
    - Review role assignments quarterly
    - Remove access for inactive users
    - Validate that permissions match current responsibilities
    - Document access decisions and approvals
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Clear Role Documentation" icon="file">
    **Maintain role assignment documentation**
    
    - Document who has what roles and why
    - Maintain approval records for sensitive role assignments
    - Create role assignment procedures for your organization
    - Train administrators on proper role management
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Common role assignment patterns

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Small Team (5-15 users)">
    **Simple structure for small organizations**
    
    - 1-2 `workspace_admin` (team leads)
    - Most users as `workspace_user`
    - 1 `theme_editor` (if visual customization needed)
    - `project_editor` assigned per project as needed
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Department (15-50 users)">
    **Structured approach for departments**
    
    - Department manager as `workspace_admin`
    - Team leads as `workspace_user` with `project_editor` on their projects
    - Specialists as `theme_editor` or specific project roles
    - Junior members start as `project_viewer`
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Enterprise (50+ users)">
    **Scalable structure for large organizations**
    
    - Multiple workspaces by business unit or region
    - `workspace_admin` per business unit
    - Role-based groups (Analysts, Developers, Designers)
    - Project-specific access using ACLs
    - Regular access reviews and automation
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

### Common role issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="User Cannot Access Workspace" icon="ban">
    **Possible Causes:**
    - User not assigned to workspace
    - No role assigned in workspace
    - User not in any workspace groups
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify user is in workspace user list
    2. Check role assignments
    3. Validate group memberships
    4. Review workspace permissions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Role Assignment Failed" icon="exclamation">
    **Possible Causes:**
    - Insufficient permissions to assign role
    - Role not available in current context
    - System-managed role being manually assigned
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify assigner has `workspace_admin` role
    2. Check role availability in current interface
    3. Confirm role can be manually assigned
    4. Review role assignment restrictions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Permissions Not Working" icon="key">
    **Possible Causes:**
    - Role permissions not properly configured
    - Cached permissions not updated
    - Conflicting role assignments
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Clear user session and re-login
    2. Verify role permission matrix
    3. Check for multiple conflicting roles
    4. Review ACL overrides
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Custom roles (future)

<Note>
Custom roles will be available in future FlowX versions, allowing organizations to create tailored access patterns.
</Note>

**Planned Custom Role Features:**
- Workspace-level custom roles with configurable permissions
- Project-level custom roles for specific access patterns
- Role templates for common organizational patterns
- Bulk role management and assignment tools
- Advanced permission inheritance models
