## Importing roles

<Info>
You can import a super admin group and its default roles in Keycloak using the following script file.
</Info>

<Card title = "Download script + roles" href = "https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/importUsersScript.zip" icon ="download">
</Card>

You need to edit the following script parameters:

* `baseAuthUrl`
* `username`
* `password`
* `realm`
* `the name of the group for super admins`

The requests package is needed in order to run the script. It can be installed with the following command:

```py
pip3 install requests
```

The script can be run with the following command:

```py
python3 importUsers.py
```
