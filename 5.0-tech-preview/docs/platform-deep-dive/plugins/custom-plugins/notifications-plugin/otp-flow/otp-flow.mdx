title: Handling OTP
description: The notifications plugin can also be used for handling the one time password (OTP) generation and validation flow.
---

The flow is made of two steps, the OTP generation and the OTP validation.

### OTP Configuration

The desired character size and expiration time of the generated one-time-passwords can also be configured using the following environment variables:

* `FLOWX_OTP_LENGTH`
* `FLOWX_OTP_EXPIRE_TIME_IN_SECONDS`

Let's go through the examples for both steps:
