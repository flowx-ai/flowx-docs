<Info>
Workspaces enable organizations to manage multiple business contexts within one FlowX instance while maintaining logical data isolation.
</Info>

## Overview

Workspaces provide multi-tenant capabilities that allow organizations to manage multiple business lines, verticals, or countries within a single FlowX instance. This feature enables logical data isolation while maintaining the flexibility to share resources when needed.

## Key concepts

### Workspace
A workspace is an isolated environment within FlowX.AI that contains its own set of projects, users, roles, and resources. Each workspace operates independently, ensuring data and configuration separation between different business contexts.

### Multi-workspace user access
Users can be granted access to multiple workspaces and can switch between them as needed. When a user has access to multiple workspaces, they can select which workspace to enter after authentication.

### Data isolation
Workspaces provide logical data isolation, meaning that resources (projects, libraries, themes, etc.) are scoped to specific workspaces and cannot be accessed from other workspaces without explicit sharing configurations.

## Workspace use cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Multiple Business Lines" icon="building">
    **Isolation Level**: High
    
    Different use cases, projects, permissions, and users between business verticals (e.g., retail vs. corporate vs. investment banking).
    
    **Shared Resources**: 
    - Shared users across business lines
    - Shared library builds
    - Shared themes (configurable)
    
    **Example**: A multinational bank with separate workspaces for Retail Banking, Corporate Banking, and Investment Banking, each with its own processes but sharing common user authentication and compliance libraries.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Regional Separation" icon="globe">
    **Isolation Level**: Medium
    
    Same business line across different regions, subject to local regulations.
    
    **Shared Resources**:
    - Libraries and common processes
    - Some shared users with multi-region access
    
    **Example**: An insurance company with workspaces for US, EU, and APAC operations, sharing global insurance processes but maintaining region-specific compliance and regulatory processes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Distinct Organizations" icon="users">
    **Isolation Level**: Highest
    
    Complete separation for different customers or organizations.
    
    **Shared Resources**: None
    
    **Example**: A consulting firm providing FlowX services to multiple clients, with completely isolated workspaces for each client organization.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How workspaces work

### Authentication and access flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Authentication">
    User logs in using their credentials through the configured identity provider
  </Step>
  <Step title="Permission Retrieval">
    System fetches the user's workspace permissions and available workspaces
  </Step>
  <Step title="Workspace Selection">
    If user has access to multiple workspaces, they select which workspace to enter
  </Step>
  <Step title="Context Loading">
    FlowX Designer loads with workspace-specific content, projects, and permissions
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Resource management

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Project Isolation">
    **Complete Separation**: Projects cannot be exported from one workspace to another on the same environment
    
    **Workspace Scoping**: Each project is tagged with its workspace ID and only accessible within that workspace
    
    **Independent Lifecycle**: Projects in different workspaces can have the same names and follow independent versioning
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Library Sharing">
    **Build Sharing**: Library builds can be reused across workspaces on the same environment
    
    **Controlled Access**: Libraries from other workspaces can be added as dependencies if permissions allow
    
    **Version Management**: Single version constraint applies across workspace boundaries for shared libraries
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Theme Management">
    **Workspace Themes**: Each workspace can have its own themes and branding
    
    **Shared Themes**: Themes can be shared between workspaces when configured appropriately
    
    **Brand Consistency**: Maintain consistent branding across business units or customize per workspace
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Access control

### Role-based access control (RBAC)

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Predefined Roles" icon="user-tag">
    - `admin` - Full workspace administration
    - `configurator` - Project and process configuration
    - `ui_ux_designer` - Interface design capabilities
    - `project_viewer` - Read-only project access
  </Card>
  <Card title="Workspace-Specific" icon="building">
    Roles are specific to each workspace - a user can have different roles in different workspaces
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### User groups

<Info>
User groups simplify permission management by allowing you to assign permissions to groups rather than individual users.
</Info>

- **Default Groups**: Each workspace includes an "Everyone in workspace" default group
- **Custom Groups**: Create groups based on teams, departments, or project requirements
- **Inherited Permissions**: Users automatically inherit permissions from their group memberships

### Access control lists (ACLs)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Resource-Specific Permissions" icon="file-shield">
    Grant fine-grained control over individual resources within a workspace, allowing exceptions to general role permissions.
    
    **Example**: A user with `project_viewer` role can be granted edit access to a specific project without becoming a full `configurator`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Exception-Based Access" icon="user-check">
    Provide specific users or groups access to individual resources without requiring full platform permissions.
    
    **Use Case**: External consultants can be given access to specific projects they're working on without broader workspace access.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Owner Management" icon="crown">
    Resource creators can manage access to their specific resources without requiring full admin intervention.
    
    **Benefit**: Project owners can add team members to their projects without needing admin approval for each addition.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  </Step>
</Steps>

### User management within workspaces

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Adding Users">
    - **Direct Assignment**: Add users directly to workspace with specific roles
    - **Group Membership**: Add users to groups that inherit workspace permissions
    - **Multi-Workspace Access**: Users can be members of multiple workspaces
  </Tab>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Migration and compatibility

### For existing FlowX customers

<Warning>
When upgrading to FlowX 5.0, a default workspace is automatically created containing all your existing resources.
</Warning>

**What Happens During Migration:**
- All existing projects, libraries, and themes are moved to a default workspace
- Current users are automatically assigned to the default workspace
- All existing functionality continues to work without changes
- Previous Keycloak roles need to be recreated as database-stored roles

### For new FlowX 5.0 installations

<Note>
New FlowX 5.0 environments do not include a default workspace. Initial setup is required.
</Note>

**Initial Setup Process:**
1. Configure the first workspace administrator user
2. Create the initial workspace
3. Set up users and role assignments
4. Begin creating projects and processes

## Limitations and considerations

### Current limitations

<Warning>
**Cross-Workspace Project Export**: Projects cannot be exported from one workspace to another on the same environment.
</Warning>

- **Resource Isolation**: Direct access to resources from other workspaces is not possible
- **Single Environment Sharing**: Library sharing only works within the same FlowX environment
- **Permission Inheritance**: Workspace permissions don't automatically inherit across workspace boundaries

### Planning considerations

- **Change Management**: Organizational alignment needed for governance models
- **User Training**: Users need to understand workspace selection and navigation
- **Governance Policies**: Clear policies needed for resource sharing and access management
- **Migration Planning**: Existing customers should plan workspace structure before creating additional workspaces
