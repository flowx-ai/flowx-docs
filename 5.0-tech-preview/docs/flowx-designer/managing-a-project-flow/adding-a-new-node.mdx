title: Adding a new node
description: Learn how to add and configure different node types to build robust process flows in FlowX.AI Designer.
---

Once you've created a process definition, the next step is to build your process flow by adding and connecting nodes. Nodes represent different steps, events, and decision points in your business process.

## What is a BPMN node?

<Card title="BPMN node" icon="circle-question">
A BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) node is a visual representation of a point in your process. Nodes are added at specific process points to denote the entrance or transition of a record within the process. Each node type has a specific purpose and configuration requirements.
</Card>

## Available node types

FlowX.AI supports a rich variety of BPMN node types that you can use to model your business processes:

### Flow control nodes

## Adding a node to your process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your Process Definition">
    1. Open **FlowX.AI Designer** and navigate to your project
    2. Go to the **Processes** section within your project
    3. Click on the process definition you want to edit

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add a Node to the Canvas">
   
    1. Locate the node palette on the left side of the screen
    2. **Drag and drop** your desired node type onto the canvas
    3. Position the node where you want it in your process flow
    
    <Tip>
      Organize your process flow from left to right for better readability. Place related nodes closer together to show their relationship.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect Nodes with Sequence Flows">
    To create a connection between nodes (called a sequence flow):
    
    1. Click on the source node to select it
    2. Click the **arrow** icon that appears
    3. Click on the target node you want to connect to
    4. A sequence flow arrow will be created between the two nodes
    
<Frame>
![Connect nodes](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/470/node_sequence.png)
</Frame>

    <Warning>
      Every node (except End nodes) must have at least one outgoing sequence flow, and every node (except Start nodes) must have at least one incoming sequence flow for the process to be valid.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Node Properties">
    After adding a node, you need to configure its properties:
    
    1. Click on the node to select it to open the properties panel
    2. Click edit icon to open the properties panel
    3. Configure basic properties like name and description
    4. Set node-specific properties depending on the node type
    5. Configure actions for the node

![Node properties](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/470/node_config.png)
</Frame>


    <Info>
      Different node types have different configuration options. For example, Gateway nodes have condition-related settings.

    </Frame>
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Actions to Nodes">
    For nodes that support actions (task nodes, user task nodes, and message nodes):
    
    1. Select the node
    2. In the properties panel, navigate to the **Actions** section
    3. Click **+ Add Action**
    4. Select the action type and configure its parameters
    

<Frame>
![Add action](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/470/node_action.png)
</Frame>

    <Note>
      Actions allow you to incorporate business rules, save data, send messages, and interact with users. Learn more about [Node Actions](../../building-blocks/actions/actions).
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common node configuration options

While each node type has specific properties, many share these common configuration options:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic Properties">
    - **Name**: A descriptive name for the node (visible in the Process Designer).
    - **Can go back**: Option available in various nodes that controls whether users can return to previous steps in a process. When enabled (set to true), it allows users to revisit and redo that step after completing it.
    - **Stage**: The stage of the process the node belongs to.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Action Properties">
    For nodes that support actions:
    - **Action Type**: Type of action to execute
    - **Action Parameters**: Configuration for the specific action
    - **Execution Order**: Sequence for multiple actions on a node
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Node type-specific configuration

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="User Task Configuration" icon="user-gear">
    - UI Component selection
    - Form configuration
    - Data validation rules
    - Task assignment settings
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Gateway Configuration" icon="code-branch">
    - Condition expressions
    - Default sequence flow
    - Branch naming
    - Gateway direction (diverging/converging)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Message Task Configuration" icon="envelope-open-text">
    - Message format
    - Target system
    - Correlation keys
    - Timeout handling
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Service Task Configuration" icon="gears">
    - Service implementation
    - Input/output mapping
    - Error handling
    - Execution parameters
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Best practices

<Tip>
**When adding nodes to your process:**

- **Use descriptive names** for nodes to make the process easier to understand
- **Organize the layout** from left to right for better readability
- **Limit the number of sequence flows** from a single node to maintain clarity
- **Group related functionality** into subprocesses to reduce complexity
- **Document assumptions and decisions** in node descriptions
- **Validate your process** regularly during development to catch errors early
</Tip>
