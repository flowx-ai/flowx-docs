## What is a process definition?

A process definition is the core building block of the FlowX.AI platform, serving as the blueprint for a business process. It's composed of nodes linked by sequences that define the path and logic of your application's workflow.

<Info>
A complete process definition must include at least one [START](../../building-blocks/node/start-end-node#start-node) and one [END](../../building-blocks/node/start-end-node#end-node) node to mark where the process begins and concludes.

## Creating a process definition

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Process Definitions Section">
    1. Open **FlowX.AI Designer** and navigate to your project
    2. Go to the **Processes** section within your project
    
    <Note>
      You must have already created a project before creating process definitions. Process definitions belong to projects and inherit project settings.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a New Process Definition">
    1. Click the **+ New Process** button in the top-right corner
    2. Enter a unique name for your process definition that clearly describes its purpose
    3. Optionally, add a description to provide context about what this process does
    4. Click **Create** to create the new process definition
    
    <Tip>
      Use a descriptive naming convention for your processes, such as "[Department]-[Function]-[Action]" (e.g., "HR-Onboarding-Application").

  </Frame>
  
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure the Process Definition">
    After creating the process definition, you'll be automatically directed to the FlowX.AI Process Designer editor where you can start building your process flow.
    
    <Frame>
      ![Process Designer Empty Canvas](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/470/process_designer_empty.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Start and End Nodes">
    Every process definition must have at least one START node and one END node:
    
    1. From the node palette on the left, drag a **START** node onto the canvas
    2. Configure the START node properties in the panel that appears
    3. Drag an **END** node onto the canvas
    4. Connect the nodes by clicking on the START node, selecting the arrow command, and then clicking on the END node
    

    <Warning>
      Without properly configured START and END nodes, your process won't be executable. The START node initializes the process, while the END node ensures proper process completion.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Build Your Process Flow">
    Expand your process by adding additional nodes between the START and END nodes:
    
    1. Drag the appropriate node types from the palette onto the canvas
    2. Configure each node's properties and actions
    3. Connect nodes in the sequence they should execute
    4. Add conditions and gateways to create branching logic

      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Your Process Definition">
    Regularly save your work by clicking the **Save** button in the editor toolbar.
    
    <Info>
      Process definitions are saved within your project but need to be included in a project version and build to be deployed to environments.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key node types

When building your process definition, you'll use various node types to model your business logic:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start and End Nodes">
    **Start Node**: Marks the beginning of a process flow, defining how a process instance is initiated.
    
    **End Node**: Marks the conclusion of a process flow, ensuring proper cleanup and completion.
    
    <Note>
      A process can have multiple START nodes (with different conditions) and multiple END nodes depending on the possible outcomes.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Task Nodes">
    **Task Node**: Used for executing automated actions without user interaction.
    
    **User Task Node**: Configures the UI components and collects data from users.
    
    **Send/Receive Message Tasks**: Used for communication with external systems and services.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Gateway Nodes">
    **Exclusive Gateway**: Creates decision points where the flow follows only one path based on conditions.
    
    **Parallel Gateway**: Splits the process into multiple parallel branches that execute simultaneously.
    
    **Inclusive Gateway**: Allows multiple paths to be taken based on conditions, unlike the exclusive gateway.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Special Nodes">
    **Subprocess Run Node**: Enables you to run a subprocess within the main process.
    
    **Timer Events**: Schedule actions to occur at specific times or after delays.
    
    **Message Events**: Handle message-based communication between processes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Adding actions to nodes

Nodes can have actions associated with them to perform specific operations:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Business Rules" icon="code">
    Execute logic, validate data, and make decisions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data Operations" icon="database">
    Save, retrieve, and manipulate process data
  </Card>
  <Card title="Integration" icon="plug">
    Connect with external systems and services
  </Card>
  <Card title="UI Interactions" icon="display">
    Send data to and receive data from users
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
Actions can only be added to certain node types: task nodes, user task nodes, and send/receive message tasks.
</Note>

## Best practices

<Tip>
**Process Definition Design Tips**:

- Start with a simple skeleton process with START and END nodes before adding complexity
- Create a logical flow from left to right in your diagram for better readability
- Group related activities into subprocesses to keep the main process clean
- Use clear naming conventions for nodes and actions
- Document your process design decisions within node descriptions
- Test your process with simulated data before publishing
</Tip>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can a process have multiple START nodes?">
    Yes, a process definition can have multiple START nodes, each with different starting conditions as long as they are on different swimlanes. This allows the same process to be initiated in different ways depending on the context.
  
  <Info>
  Process definition cannot contain multiple start nodes on the same swimlane.
  </Info>


  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I modify an existing process definition?">
    To modify an existing process, navigate to the Processes section in your project, find the process you want to edit, and click on it. Then click the "Edit Process" button to open it in the Process Designer.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I reuse parts of a process definition?">
    Yes, you can create reusable components as subprocesses, which can then be called from multiple main processes. This promotes reusability and maintainability.
  </Accordion>

  
<Accordion title="Can I export or import process definitions?">
  Yes, FlowX.AI allows you to export and import process definitions. When you export a process definition, it creates a structured folder containing multiple files:

  - A root export folder with a unique identifier
  - A process subfolder containing manifest.json and metadata.json files
  - A version subfolder containing the actual process definition JSON file

  This structured export can be imported into other projects or environments, facilitating sharing, backup, and version control of your processes.
