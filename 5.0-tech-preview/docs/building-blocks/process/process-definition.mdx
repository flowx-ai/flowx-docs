Once a process is defined and set as published on the platform, it can be executed, monitored, and optimized. When a business process is started, a new process instance is created based on the process definition.

## Data model

In the Data Model, you can add new key-pair values, which enables you to use shortcuts when adding new keys using the UI Designer, without having to switch back and forth between menus.

## Swimlanes

Swimlanes offer a useful method of organizing process nodes based on process participants. By utilizing swimlanes, you can establish controlled access to specific process nodes for particular user roles.

#### Adding new swimlanes

To add new swimlanes, please follow these steps:

1. Access the **FlowX.AI Designer**.
2. Open an existing process definition or create a new one.
3. Identify the default swimlane and select it to display the contextual menu.

</Frame>

<Tip>
With the contextual menu, you can easily perform various actions related to swimlanes, such as adding or removing swimlanes or reordering them. 
</Tip>

4. Choose the desired location for the new swimlane, either below or above the default swimlane.
5. Locate and click the **add swimlane icon** to create the new swimlane.

## Settings

### Process Name

* **Process definition name**: Edit the process definition name.

<Info>
Name can only contain letters, numbers and the following special characters: [] () . _ -
</Info>

### General

In the General settings, you can edit the process definition name, include the process in reporting, set general data, and configure expiry time expression using Cron Expressions and ISO 8601 formatting.

* **Available Platforms** (Single Choice): This enable configuration (Navigation Areas, UI Designer, Misconfigurations) only for the specific platform selected:

    - **Web Only**:  If the navigation areas are defined exclusively for the Web, the process should remain set to Web. This is because it is optimized solely for web usage and would not provide the same level of functionality or user experience on mobile devices
    - **Mobile Only**: If the navigation areas are defined only for Mobile, the process should be set to Mobile. This ensures that the process leverages mobile-specific features and design considerations, providing an optimal experience on mobile devices.
    - **Omnichannel**: If the existing process has navigation areas defined for both Web and Mobile platforms, it should be set to Omnichannel. This ensures that users have a consistent experience regardless of the platform they are using.


<Tip>
This setting is available starting with **v4.1.0** platform release.
</Tip>


<Info>
Navigation Areas, UI Designer and misconfigurations will be affected by this setting.
</Info>

<Info>
By default, new processes are set to **Web Only**. This ensures that they are initially optimized for web-based usage, providing a starting point for most users and scenarios.
</Info>

* **Use process in reporting**: When enabled, this setting includes the process in reporting.
* **Use process in task management**: Enabling this option creates tasks that are displayed in the Task Manager plugin. For more details, refer to the [**Task Management**](../../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/task-management/task-management-overview) section.
* **General data**: Refers to customizable data that can be both set and received in a response context.
* **Expiry time**: A user can set up an expiry time expression on a process definition to specify an expiry date.

| **Example**               | **Expression**         | **Explanation**                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Daily Expiry at Midnight  | `0 0 0 * * ?`          | Sets the process to expire at 00:00 (midnight) every day. The `?` is used in the day-of-week field to ignore its value. |
| Hourly Expiry on Weekdays | `0 0 9-17 * * MON-FRI` | Sets the process to expire at the start of each hour between 9 AM and 5 PM on weekdays (Monday to Friday).              |
| Expiry After a Duration   | `PT3M22S`              | Sets the process to expire after a duration of 3 minutes and 22 seconds from the start, using **ISO 8601 format**.      |


<Tip>
FlowX support Spring cron expressions. They  **must always include six fields**: `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, `day of month`, `month`, and `day of week`.  
This differs from traditional UNIX cron, which uses only five fields. Be sure to include the `seconds` field in Spring cron expressions to avoid errors.
</Tip>

<Info>
The cron expression format should include seconds (0), minutes (0), hours (0), and then wildcards for the day, month, and day of the week fields. The `?` sign in the day-of-week field is used when the day-of-month field is already specified (or ignored in this case).
</Info>

<Info>
You can use both ISO 8601 duration format (`PT3M22S`) and cron expressions (`0 0 0 * * ?`, `0 0 9-17 * * MON-FRI`) to define `expiryTime` expressions for process definitions.
</Info>


For more information about **Cron Expressions** and **ISO 8601** formatting, check the following section:

### Permissions

After defining roles in the identity provider solution, they will be available to be used in the process definition settings panel for configuring swimlane access. 

When you create a new swimlane, it comes with two default permissions assigned based on a specific role: execute and self-assign. Other permissions can be added manually, depending on the needs of the user.

#### Allow multiple swimlane executors

You can switch per swimlane from **Swimlane owner + multiple executors** to **only Swimlane Owner**.

When this option is enabled, permissions can be configured at UI Element level in User Tasks from the selected Swimlane.

### Task management

* **Use process in task management**
    * The Use Process in Task Management option enables the integration of a process definition with the Task Manager system. 
    * By activating this feature, the process becomes available for managing tasks within Task Management, allowing data, tasks, and status updates to flow between the process and the Task Manager.
* **Application url** 
    * The Application URL is the endpoint or link that directs users to the specific application instance where a process is executed. It serves as a reference point for accessing and managing tasks associated with a process directly from the Task Manager.
    * Follows a standard format, e.g., `{baseURL}/appId/buildId/processes/resourceId/instance`.
    * Can be dynamically defined using configuration parameters (e.g., `${genericParameter}`) or set at the process data level using business rules.
* **Keys to send to Task Manager**
    * The Keys to Send to Task Manager configuration specifies the data fields (keys) from a process definition that are sent to the Task Manager for indexing and display. 
    * These keys are used to customize task-related views, filters, and parameters, making them accessible for tracking, filtering, and managing tasks effectively.

<Tip>
Important:

* Keys must exist in the process data model.
* Keys need re-indexing if their type or structure is updated in the data model.
</Tip>

### Data Search

The **Search indexing** tab allows you to configure process data keys used for indexing data stored in a process. These keys facilitate efficient searching and filtering of process instances based on the indexed data.

<Tip>
Process Data Keys: These are paths or fields in the process definition that store relevant data. For example, customerDetails.fullName might correspond to a field capturing the full name of a customer.
