## Overview

The Data Model serves as the foundation for managing structured information throughout your process definitions. It provides a centralized approach to define, organize, and maintain the data attributes that drive your business processes and user interfaces.

### Attribute types

The Data Model supports the following attribute types:

* STRING
* NUMBER
* CURRENCY
* BOOLEAN
* OBJECT
* ARRAY
    * ARRAY OF STRINGS
    * ARRAY OF NUMBERS
    * ARRAY OF BOOLEANS
    * ARRAY OF OBJECTS
    * ARRAY OF ENUMS
* ENUM
* DATE

#### Currency attribute

Currencies are managed using an object structure that ensures accurate representation and localization.

</Frame>


- **Currency Object Structure**: 
  - Includes `amount` (numerical value) and `code` (ISO 4217 currency code, e.g., USD, EUR).
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "amount": 12000.78,
      "code": "USD"
    }
    ```
- **Regional Formatting**:
  - Currency values adapt to regional conventions for grouping, decimals, and symbol placement. For instance:
    - **en-US (United States)**: `$12,000.78` (symbol before the value, comma for grouping, dot for decimals).
    - **ro-RO (Romania)**: `12.000,78 RON` (dot for grouping, comma for decimals, code appended).
- **Fallback Behavior**: If the `code` is null, the system defaults to the locale's predefined currency settings.
- **UI Integration**:
  - Currency input fields dynamically format values based on locale settings and save the `amount` and `code` into the data store.
  - Sliders and other components follow the same behavior, formatting values and labels according to the locale.

#### Date attribute

Dates are represented in ISO 8601 format and dynamically formatted based on locale and application settings.

</Frame>

- **Locale-Specific Date Formats**: FlowX dynamically applies regional date formatting rules based on the locale. For instance:
  - **en-US (United States)**: `MM/DD/YYYY` → `09/28/2024`
  - **fr-FR (France)**: `DD/MM/YYYY` → `28/09/2024`
- **Customizable Formats**: You can choose from predefined formats (e.g., short, medium, long, full) or define custom formats at both application and UI Designer levels.
- **Timezone Handling**:
  - **Standard Date**: Adjusts to the current timezone.
  - **Date Agnostic**: Ignores time zones, using GMT for consistent representation.
- **ISO 8601 Compliance**: Ensures compatibility with international standards.

#### Number attribute

The **Number** attribute type supports two subtypes: **integers** and **floating point numbers**, providing flexibility to represent whole numbers or decimal values as required.

</Frame>

- **Subtypes**
    - **Integer**: Represents whole numbers without any fractional or decimal part.
        - Example: `1, 42, 1000`
    - **Floating Point**: Represents numbers with a decimal point, enabling precise storage and representation of fractional values.
        - Example: `3.14, 0.01, -123.456`
- **Locale-Specific Formatting**:
  - Numbers adapt to regional conventions for decimal separators and digit grouping. For example:
    - **en-US (United States)**: `1,234.56` (comma for grouping, dot for decimals)
    - **de-DE (Germany)**: `1.234,56` (dot for grouping, comma for decimals)
    - **fr-FR (France)**: `1 234,56` (space for grouping, comma for decimals)
- **Precision Settings**:
  - **Minimum Decimals**: Ensures a minimum number of decimal places are displayed, adding trailing zeros if necessary.
  - **Maximum Decimals**: Limits the number of decimal places stored, rounding values to the defined precision.

</Frame>

<Tip>
These settings can be overriden at the application level or in the **UI Designer** for specific components.
</Tip>

- **Validation**:
  - Enforce range constraints (e.g., minimum and maximum values).
  - Input fields automatically apply formatting masks to prevent invalid data entry.

## Creating and managing a data model 

In the Data Model, you can add new key-pair values, allowing seamless integration with the UI Designer. This functionality enables quick shortcuts for adding new keys without switching between menus.

<Tip>
**Key Naming Conventions**:
- Keys in the data model are case-sensitive. This means 'customerName' and 'CustomerName' would be treated as two distinct attributes.
- It's recommended to follow a consistent naming convention (such as camelCase) throughout your data model to avoid confusion.
- Special characters and spaces in keys should be avoided.
</Tip>

></video>
</Frame>

### Validation rules

You can define validation rules for your data model attributes to ensure data integrity throughout your processes:

- **Required Fields**: Mark attributes that must have values before a process can proceed
- **Range Validation**: Set minimum and maximum values for numeric attributes
- **Pattern Matching**: Define regular expression patterns for string validation
- **Custom Validation**: Implement custom validation logic using business rules

<Tip>
Validation rules can be defined at the data model level and enforced throughout UI components, business rules, and integration points, ensuring consistent data quality.
</Tip>

## Data model reference

The "View References" feature allows you to see where specific attributes are used within the data model. This includes:

- **Process Keys**: Lists all process keys linked to an attribute.
- **UI Elements**: Displays references such as the element label, node name, and UI Element key.

## Sensitive data

Protect sensitive information by flagging specific keys in the data model. This ensures data is hidden from process details and browser console outputs.

## Reporting

The **Use in Reporting** tag allows you to designate keys for use in the reporting plugin, enabling efficient tracking and analysis.

## Integration with other platform features

The Data Model serves as the backbone for numerous platform features, enabling seamless data flow between different components of your FlowX application.

### Integration with UI Designer

The Data Model directly integrates with the UI Designer, allowing you to:

- Bind UI components to data model attributes
- Create dynamic UI layouts based on data model values
- Implement validation and formatting rules consistently across interfaces

### Integration with workflows

When designing workflows in the Integration Designer, you can leverage the Data Model to:

- Pass data from processes to workflows using the Start Integration Workflow action
- Map data between your process and external systems
- Transform and validate data during integration flows

### Decision model integration

Data model attributes can be used as inputs for business rules, enabling:

- Complex business rule implementation using structured data
- Consistent data handling across decision points

## Best practices

### Structuring your data model

- **Use hierarchical structures**: Organize related data in nested objects to improve maintainability
- **Consistent naming**: Adopt a consistent naming convention for all attributes
- **Documentation**: Add clear descriptions for complex attributes to improve team understanding
- **Modularization**: Group related attributes into logical objects rather than using flat structures


### Version control and migration

When evolving your data model across versions:

- **Backwards compatibility**: Ensure changes don't break existing processes
- **Migration strategy**: Plan for how existing process instances will handle schema changes
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of data model changes between versions

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

- **Missing data**: Ensure all required attributes are defined in your data model before referencing them
- **Type mismatches**: Verify that attributes are assigned the correct data type
- **Validation errors**: Check validation rules when data appears to be rejected

### Debugging tips

- Use the data model reference feature to track attribute usage
- Examine process instance data to verify attribute values
- Review UI component bindings to ensure proper data mapping

## Summary

The Data Model is a powerful feature that enables structured data management across your FlowX applications. By following best practices for design, validation, and integration, you can build robust process applications with consistent data handling throughout all stages of your business processes.
