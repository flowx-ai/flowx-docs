title: Start process and inherit values 
api: POST {ENGINE_URL}/api/process/{PROCESS_DEFINITION_NAME}/start/inheritFrom/{RELATED_PROCESS_INSTANCE_UUID}

The `paramsToInherit` map should hold the needed values on one the following keys, depending on the desired outcome:

* `paramsToCopy` - this is used to pick only a subset of parameters to be inherited from the parent process; it holds the list of key names that will be inherited from the parent parameters
* `withoutParams` - this is used in case we need to remove some parameter values from the parent process before inheriting them; it holds the list of key names that will be removed from the parent parameters
If none of these keys have values, all the parameter values from the parent process will be inherited by the new process.

<ParamField path="RELATED_PROCESS_INSTANCE_UUID" type="string" required>
  The UUID of the related process instance from which values will be inherited.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="PROCESS_DEFINITION_NAME" type="string" required>
  The name of the process definition to be started.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="paramsToInherit" type="string" required>
  A map containing information about which values to copy from the related process instance.
</ParamField>
