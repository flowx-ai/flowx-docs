title: Send message/receive message tasks
description: Send message task and Receive message task nodes are used to handle the interaction between a running process and external systems. This is done using [**Kafka**](../../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-kafka-concepts).

## Send message task

This node is used to configure messages that should be sent to external systems.

### Configuring a send message task

Node configuration is done by accessing the **Node Config** tab. You have the following configuration options for a send message task:

#### General configuration

Inside the **General Config** tab, you have the following properties:

* **Node Name** - the name of the node
* **Can Go Back** - switching this option to true will allow users to return to this step after completing it

<Info>
When encountering a step with `canGoBack` switched to false, all steps found behind it will become unavailable.
</Info>

* [**Swimlane**](../../platform-deep-dive/user-roles-management/swimlanes) - choose a swimlane (if there are multiple swimlanes on the process) to ensure only certain user roles have access to certain process nodes; if there are no multiple swimlanes, the value is **Default**
* [**Stage**](../../platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/task-management/using-stages) - assign a stage to the node

</Frame>

To configure a send message task, we first need to add a new node and then configure an [**action**](../../terms/flowx-actions) (**Kafka Send Action** type):

<Steps>

1. Open <Tooltip tip ="The process designer is a component of FlowX.Ai Designer that allows users to create and design business processes using process definitions.">**Process Designer** </Tooltip> and start configuring a process.
2. Add a **send message task** node.
3. Select the **send message task** node and open the **Node Configuration**.
4. Add an <Tooltip tip ="Actions in the FLOWX.AI platform are used to define the activity that a node has to handle. They can have various types and are used to specify the communication details for plugins or integrations."> **action** </Tooltip>, the type of the action set to **Kafka Send Action**.
5. A few action parameters will need to be filled in depending on the selected action type.

</Steps>

Multiple options are available for this type of action and can be configured via the FLOWX.AI Designer. To configure and [add an action to a node](../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/adding-an-action-to-a-node.md), use the [**Actions**](../../terms/flowx-actions) tab at the node level, which has the following configuration options:

* [Action Edit](#action-edit)
* [Back in steps (for Manual actions)](#back-in-steps)
* [Parameters](#parameters)
* [Data to send (for Manual actions)](#data-to-send)

#### Action Edit

* **Name** - used internally to make a distinction between different [actions](../actions/actions.md) on nodes in the process. We recommend defining an action naming standard to easily find the process actions
* **Order** - if multiple actions are defined on the same node, set the running order using this option
* **Timer Expression** - it can be used if a delay is required on that action. The format used for this is [ISO 8601 duration format](./timer-events/timer-expressions#iso-8601) (for example, a delay of 30 seconds will be set up as `PT30S`)
* **Action Type** - should be set to **Kafka Send Action** for actions used to send messages to external systems
* **Trigger Type** (options are Automatic/Manual) - choose if this action should be triggered automatically (when the process flow reaches this step) or manually (triggered by the user); in most use cases, this will be set to automatic
* **Required Type** (options are Mandatory/Optional) - automatic actions can only be defined as mandatory. Manual actions can be defined as mandatory or optional.
* **Repeatable** - should be checked if the action can be triggered multiple times
* **Autorun Children** - when this is switched on, the child actions (the ones defined as mandatory and automatic) will run immediately after the execution of the parent action is finalized

#### Back in steps

* **Allow BACK on this action** - back in the process is a functionality that allows you to go back in a business process and redo a series of previous actions in the process, or for more details, check [**Moving a Token Backwards in a Process**](../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/moving-a-token-backwards-in-a-process) section

</Frame>

#### Data to Send

* **Keys** - are used when data is sent from the frontend via an action to validate the data (you can find more information in the [User Task Configuration](user-task-node/) section)

<Warning>
You can configure **Data to Send** option only when the action **trigger type** is **Manual**.

### Example of a send message task usage

Send a message to a CRM integration to request a search in the local database:

#### Action Edit

* **Name** - pick a name that makes it easy to figure out what this action does, for example, `sendRequestToSearchClient`
* **Order** - 1
* **Timer Expression** - this remains empty if we want the action to be triggered as soon as the token reaches this node
* **Action Type** - Kafka Send Action
* **Trigger Type** - _Automatic_ - to trigger this action automatically
* **Required Type** - _Mandatory_ - to make sure this action will be run before advancing to the next node
* **Repeatable** - false, it only needs to run once

#### Parameters

<Info>
Parameters can be added either using the **Custom** option (where you configure everything on the spot) or by using **From Integration** and import parameters already defined in an integration.

More details about **Integrations Management** you can find [here](../../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/integration-management/integration-management-overview).
</Info>

##### Custom

* **Topics** - `ai.flowx.in.crm.search.v1` the Kafka topic on which the CRM listens for requests
* **Message** - `{ "clientType": "${application.client.clientType}", "personalNumber": "${personalNumber.client.personalNumber}" }` - the message payload will have two keys, `clientType` and `personalNumber`, both with values from the process instance
* **Headers** - `{"processInstanceId": ${processInstanceId}}`

## Receive Message Task

This type of node is used when we need to wait for a reply from an external system.

<Frame>

![Receive Message Task](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/receive-task%20_node.svg#center)

</Frame>

The reply from the external system will be saved in the process instance values, on a specified key. If the message needs to be processed at a later time, a timeout can be set using the [ISO 8601](./timer-events/timer-expressions) format.

For example, let's think about a CRM microservice that waits to receive requests to look for a user in a database. It will send back the response when a topic is configured to listen for the response.

![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/kafka_receive_message.png)

### Configuring a Receive Message Task

The values you need to configure for this node are the following:

* **Topic Name** - the topic name where the [process engine](../../platform-deep-dive/core-components/flowx-engine) listens for the response (this should be added to the platform and match the topic naming rule for the engine to listen to it) - `ai.flowx.out.crm.search.v1`

<Warning>
A naming pattern must be defined on the process engine to use the defined topics. It is important to know that all the events that start with a configured pattern will be consumed by the Engine. For example, `KAFKA_TOPIC_PATTERN` is the topic name pattern that the Engine listens to for incoming Kafka events.
</Warning>

* **Key Name** - will hold the result received from the external system; if the key already exists in the process values, it will be overwritten - `crmResponse`

#### From integration

After defining one integration (inside [Integration Management](../../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/integration-management/)), you can open a compatible node and start using already defined integrations.

* **Topics** - topics defined in your integration 
* **Message** - the **Message Data Model** from your integration
* **Headers** - all integrations have `processInstanceId` as a default header parameter; add any other relevant parameters
