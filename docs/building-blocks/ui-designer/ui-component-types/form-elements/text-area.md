![Text area](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/text_area.png)

A text area is a form element used to capture multi-line input from users in a conversational interface. The text area component is typically used for longer inputs such as descriptions, comments, or feedback, providing users with more space to type their responses. 

It is an important tool for creating intuitive and effective conversational interfaces that can collect and process large amounts of user input.
