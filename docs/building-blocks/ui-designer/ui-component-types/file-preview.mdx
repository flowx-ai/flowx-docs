The File Preview element settings consist of the following properties:

* **Title** - the title of the element (if it is downloaded or shared - the file name should be the title used in preview component)
* **Has subtitle** - the subtitle of the element
* **Display mode** - depending on the selected display method the following properties are available:
    * **Inline** → **Has accordion**:  
        * `false` - display preview inline, without expand/collapse option
        * `true` - Default View: Collapsed - display preview inline, with expand/collapse option, by default collapsed
        * `true` - Default View: Expanded - display preview inline, with expand/collapse option, by default expanded

    * **Modal** → view icon is enabled 
* **Source Type** - 
    * **Process Data** - process key where the document is found (creates the binding between the element and process data)
    * **Static** - URL of the document

It's worth noting that the inline modal view can raise accessibility issues if the file preview's height exceeds the screen height.
