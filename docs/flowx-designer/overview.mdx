#### Integration management

* Integration management helps you configure integrations between the following components: [**FLOWX Process engine**](../terms/flowxai-process-engine), [**plugins**](../terms/flowx-plugins), or different adapters
* Integration management enables you to keep track of each integration and its correspondent component and different scenarios used: creating an OTP, document generation, notifications, etc

</Accordion>

<Accordion title ="Platform status" icon ="signal-bars">

<summary>Platform status</summary>

* you can check the platform's health by using the **Platform Status** feature
* you can also check the installed versions against the suggested versions for each [**FLOWX Component**](../terms/microservices)

</Accordion>

## Managing process definitions

A [**process definition**](../terms/flowx-process-definition) is uniquely identified by its name and version number.

## Viewing active process instances

The complete list of active [**process instances**](../terms/flowx-process-instance) is visible from the FLOWX Designer. They can be filtered by [**process definition**](../terms/flowx-process-definition) names and searched by their unique ID. You can also view the current process instance status and data.

## Managing CMS

Using the content management feature you can perform multiple actions that enable manipulation of the content and simplification of it. You need first to deploy the CMS service in your infrastructure, so you can start defining and using the custom content types described in the **Content Management** tab above.

## Managing tasks

The Task Manager [**plugin**](../terms/flowx-plugins) has the scope to show a process that you defined in Designer, offering a more business-oriented view. It also offers interactions at the assignment level.

## Managing users access

Access Management is used to administrate users, roles and groups, directly in FLOWX Designer. Access Management helps you to access the identity management solution (keycloak/[RH-SSO](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on)) through its API, extracting all the necessary details. Access Management is based on user roles that need to be configured in the identity management solution.

## Managing integrations

Integration management enables you to keep track of each integration and its correspondent component and different scenarios used: creating an OTP, document generation, notifications, etc.

## Checking platform status

You can quickly check the health status of all the [**FLOWX services**](../terms/microservices) and all of your custom connectors.
