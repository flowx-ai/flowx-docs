title: Adding a new node
description: Once you create a new [**process definition**](../../terms/flowx-process-definition), you can start configuring it by adding new [**nodes**](../../terms/flowx-node).
---
You can choose between a series of available node types below. For an overview of what each node represents, see [BPMN 2.0 basic concepts](../../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-bpmn/bpmn-basic-concepts.md):

- [Start Event](../../building-blocks/node/start-end-node.md)
- [End Event](../../building-blocks/node/start-end-node.md)
- [Service Task](../../building-blocks/node/task-node.md)
- [User Task](../../building-blocks/node/user-task-node.md)
- [Parallel Gateway](../../building-blocks/node/parallel-gateway.md)
- [Exclusive Gateway](../../building-blocks/node/exclusive-gateway-node.md)
- [Send Message Task](../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node.md)
- [Receive Message Task](../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node.md)
- [Start Milestone](../../building-blocks/node/milestone-node.md)
- [End Milestone](../../building-blocks/node/milestone-node.md)

### Steps for creating a new node

To create a new node on an existing process:

<Steps>

<Step>
Open [**FLOWX Designer**](../../terms/flowx-ai-designer) and from the **Processes** tab select **Definitions**.
</Step>
<Step>
Open your **process**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click the **Edit process** button from the process definition.
</Step>
<Step>
Drag and drop one **node element**.
</Step>
<Step>
To connect the node that you just created:
* Click the node, select the **arrow** command
* Click the node that you wish to link to the newly added node
</Step>
</Steps>

For each new [**node**](../../terms/flowx-node), you can set its name, and a set of values (timeout, topic name, key name) and you can also add various [actions](../../building-blocks/actions/actions.md) to it.
