# Managing a process flow

Now that we've covered the [**main components**](../../terms/microservices) and building blocks of the [**FLOWX Platform**](../../terms/flowx), let's go through the steps needed to design a new [**process flow**](../../terms/flowx-process) using the [**FLOWX Designer**](../../terms/flowx-process-designer). üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

[Creating a new process definition](creating-a-new-process-definition)

[Adding a new node](adding-a-new-node)

[Adding an action to a node](adding-an-action-to-a-node)

[Handling decisions in the flow](handling-decisions-in-the-flow)

[Adding more flow branches](adding-more-flow-branches)

[Creating a user interface](creating-a-user-interface)

After following all the above steps you should be able to replicate an end-to-end process flow and know how FLOWX Designer works. :pencil2:
