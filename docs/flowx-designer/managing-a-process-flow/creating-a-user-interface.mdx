title: Creating a user interface

You can configure interfaces for the processes for both generated and custom screens.

## Creating a stepper structure

To create a stepper structure:

<Steps>
<Step>
 Go to [**FLOWX Designer**](../../terms/flowx-ai-designer) and go to the **Definitions** tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Click on the **New process** button, using the **breadcrumbs** from the top-right corner.
</Step>
<Step>
Add a **start node**.
</Step>
<Step>
Add a new **milestone** to describe all the user tasks.
</Step>
<Step>
Add a **user task** that will represent the first card of our step.
</Step>
<Step>
Add an **end milestone** for both the step and the stepper.
</Step>
<Step>
End your process with an **end node**.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring the UI

* All the UI elements are configured via the [**UI designer**](../../terms/flowx-ai-ui-designer)
* Starting from our basic process, we need to set the start of the stepper template config
* It is enough to open the drag and drop menu and add a Stepper template config for now
* For the first step, it will be useful to add also a label
* Clear the cache to test what we have until now

### Testing the flow that we have

<Steps>
<Step>
From the **process definition**, click the **Start process** button.
</Step>
<Step>
We will not pass any data to this process so an empty object `{}`.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Start Process** and you will see the first step.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Adding a card with one input
<Steps>
<Step>
Go to your **user task** (this will represent the **first card** of your step).
</Step>
<Step>
Add a **`CARD`** (this is the UI card element).
</Step>
<Step>
Add a **Form** to it (Form elements group inputs together).
</Step>
<Step>
Add an **input** into the form:
* Configure the **key** - you can use the key to retrieve the data form saved on that element
* Configure a **label**
</Step>
</Steps>

### Testing our first input

<Steps>
<Step>
**Start** one more time **the process** that you just configured.
</Step>
<Step>
The **input** is displayed.
</Step>
<Step>
Test the **input**.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Adding second input and a submit action

<Steps>
<Step>
Go to your **user task** node and add a new input via **Node UI designer**.
</Step>
<Step>
Now go back to the process and add a new [**action rule**](../../building-blocks/actions/actions.md):
   * first we need to configure the action - the action is called when the button is pressed - the action should be **Manual** (not automatic because it is triggered by a user)
   * we need to keep in mind the name of the action - `saveDataFirstStep`
</Step>
<Step>
Go back to the Node UI designer and add a button (we need to link the **button** to the **action** based on the name).
</Step>
</Steps>
