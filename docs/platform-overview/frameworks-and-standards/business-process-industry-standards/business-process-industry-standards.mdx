# Business process industry and standards

The core element of the platform is a process. Think of it as a representation of your business use case, for example making a request for a new credit card, placing an online food order, registering your new car or creating an online fundraiser supporting your cause. 

To easily design and model process flows, we use the standard [**BPMN 2.0**](../../../terms/bpmn) graphical representation. In case you are not familiar with the standard, the next section covers some basic concepts:

Some process steps might require making business checks or validations. Business rules and decisions can be defined on nodes using either the DMN standard or the MVEL expression language. You can use the one you are most comfortable with.
