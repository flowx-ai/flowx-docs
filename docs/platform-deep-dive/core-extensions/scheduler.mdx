title: Scheduler
description: The Scheduler is part of the core extensions of the [**FLOWX.AI platform**](../../../terms/flowx). It can be easily added to your custom FLOWX deployment to **enhance the core platform capabilities with functionality specific to scheduling messages.**
---

The service offers the possibility to schedule a message that you only need to process after a configured time period.

It can be quickly deployed on the chosen infrastructure and then connected to the [**FLOWX.AI Engine**](../../../terms/flowxai-process-engine) through Kafka events.

Let's go through the steps needed in order to deploy and set up the service:


[Scheduler setup guide](../../../platform-setup-guides/scheduler-setup-guide.md)


We've prepared some examples of various use cases where this service is useful:

## Using the scheduler

After deploying the scheduler service in your infrastructure, you can start using it to schedule messages that you need to process at a later time.

One such example would be to use the scheduler service to expire processes that were started but haven't been finished.

<Warning>
First you need to check the configured topics match the ones configured in the engine.
</Warning>

For example the engine topics KAFKA_TOPIC_PROCESS_SCHEDULE_OUT_SET and KAFKA_TOPIC_PROCESS_SCHEDULE_OUT_STOP **should be the same with the ones configured in the scheduler** (`KAFKA_TOPIC_SCHEDULE_IN_SET` and `KAFKA_TOPIC_SCHEDULE_IN_STOP`)

When a process is scheduled to expire, the engine sends the following message to the scheduler service (on the topic `KAFKA_TOPIC_SCHEDULE_IN_SET`):

```json
{
  "applicationName": "onboarding",
  "applicationId": "04f82408-ee66-4c68-8162-b693b06bba00",
  "payload": {
    "scheduledEventType": "EXPIRE_PROCESS",
    "processInstanceUuid": "04f82408-ee66-4c68-8162-b693b06bba00"
  },
  "scheduledTime": 1621412209.353327,
  "responseTopicName": "ai.flowx.process.expire.staging"
}
```

The scheduled time should be defined as `java.time.Instant`.

At the scheduled time, the payload will be sent back to the response topic defined in the message, like so:

```json
{
  "scheduledEventType": "EXPIRE_PROCESS",
  "processInstanceUuid": "04f82408-ee66-4c68-8162-b693b06bba00"
}
```

If you don't need the scheduled message anymore, you can discard it by sending the following message (on the topic `KAFKA_TOPIC_SCHEDULE_IN_STOP`)

```json
{
  "applicationName": "onboarding",
  "applicationId": "04f82408-ee66-4c68-8162-b693b06bba00"
}
```

These fields, `applicationName` and `applicationId` are used to uniquely identify a scheduled message.
