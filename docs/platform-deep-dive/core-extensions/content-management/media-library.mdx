## Icons

The Icons feature allows you to personalize the icons used in UI elements. By uploading SVG files through the Media Library and marking them, you can choose icons from the available list in the UI Designer.

<Info>
When selecting icons in the UI Designer, only SVG files marked as icons in the Media Library will be displayed.
</Info>

<Info>
To ensure optimal visual rendering and alignment within your UI elements, it is recommended to use icons with small sizes such as: 16px, 24px, 32px.

Using icons specifically designed for these sizes helps maintain consistency and ensures a visually pleasing user interface. It is advisable to select icons from icon sets that provide these size options or to resize icons proportionally to fit within these dimensions.
<Warning>
Icons are displayed or rendered at their original, inherent size.
</Warning>
</Info>

### Customization

Content-specific icons pertain to the content of UI elements, such as icons for [input fields](../../../../building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/input-form-field.md) or [send message buttons](../../../../building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/buttons.md). These icons are readily accessible in the [UI Designer](../../../../building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-designer.md).
