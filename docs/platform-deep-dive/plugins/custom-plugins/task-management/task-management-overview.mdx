## Process status updates

Task Manager displays various statuses based on process state:


| Status         | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Created**    | This status is visible only if there is an issue with the process creation. If the process is error-free in its configuration, you will see the **Started** status instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Started**    | Indicates that the process is in progress and running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Finished**   | The process has reached an end node and completed its execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Failed**     | Displayed when a [CronJob](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/) is enabled in the [FLOWX engine](../../../core-components/flowx-engine/). For example, if a CronJob is triggered but not completed on time, tasks move to the `FAILED` status.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Expired**    | <p>Displayed when <code>expiryTime</code> field is defined within the process definition. To set up an <code>expiryTime</code> function, follow these steps</p><ol><li>Go to <strong>FLOWX Designer > Processes > Definitions</strong>.</li><li>Select a process and click the "<strong>â‹®</strong>" <strong></strong> button, then choose <strong>Settings.</strong></li><li>Inside the <strong>General</strong> tab, you can edit the <strong>Expiry time</strong> field.</li></ol> |
| **Aborted**    | This status is available for processes that also contain subprocesses. When a subprocess is running (and the [token is moved backward](https://docs.flowx.ai/flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/moving-a-token-backwards-in-a-process) to redo a series of previous actions) - the subprocess will be aborted.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Dismissed**  | Available for processes that contain subprocesses. It is displayed when a user stops a subprocess.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **On hold**    | Freezes the process, blocking further actions. A superuser can trigger this status for clarification or unfreeze.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Terminated** | A request is sent via Kafka to terminate a process instance, ending all active tokens in the current process or subprocesses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Task Assignment and Reassignment 

Consider this scenario: you're the HR manager overseeing the onboarding process for new employees. In order to streamline this operation, you've opted to leverage a task manager plugin. This process consists of two key phases: the Initiation Stage and the Account Setup Stage, each requiring a designated team member.

The Initiation Stage has successfully concluded, marking the transition to the Account Setup Stage. At this juncture, it's essential to reassign the task, originally assigned to John Doe, to Jane Doe, a valuable member of the backoffice team.

## Managing On-Hold Projects

As a project manager overseeing various ongoing projects, you may need to temporarily pause one due to unforeseen circumstances. To manage this, you use the "On Hold" status.

## Adding Comments 

When handling on-hold projects, document the reasons, inform the team, and plan for resumption. This pause helps address issues and ensures a smoother project flow upon resuming. Never forget to add comments:


![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/tsk_hold_comment.gif)

## Viewing the Application

In the task management tab, paste the application URL where the process is loaded, following this format:

```
{baseURL}/processes/instance
```

Example:

<Tip>
You can also use a defined generic parameter as a URL: `${genericParameter}`.

</Tip>

## Bulk updates

Send bulk update requests via Kafka (using Process Engine) to perform multiple operations at once. Use the Kafka topic:

* `KAFKA_TOPIC_PROCESS_OPERATIONS_BULK_IN` (defined in Process Engine) to send operations from "KAFKA_TOPIC_PROCESS_OPERATIONS_IN" as an array, allowing multiple operations at once. More details [**here**](../../../../platform-setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/flowx-engine-setup-guide.md#topics-related-to-the-task-management-plugin).

Example of a bulk request:

```json
{

  "operations": [
    {
      "operationType": "HOLD",
      "taskId": "some task id",
      "processInstanceUuid": "d3aabfd8-d041-4c62-892f-22d17923b223", // the id of the process instance
      "swimlaneName": "Default", //name of the swimlane
      "owner": null,
      "author": "john.doe@flowx.ai",
      "requestID": "1234567891"
    },
    {
      "operationType": "HOLD",
      "taskId": "some task id",
      "processInstanceUuid": "d3aabfd8-d041-4c62-892f-22d17923b223",
      "swimlaneName": "Default", //name of the swimlane
      "owner": null,
      "author": "jonh.doe@flowx.ai",
      "requestID": "1234567890"
    }
  ]
}      
```
