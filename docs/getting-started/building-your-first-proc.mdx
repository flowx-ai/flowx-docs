## Designing the BPMN Process: Requesting a New Credit Card from a Bank App

Let's initiate by designing the BPMN process diagram for a sample use case: requesting a new credit card from a bank app.

## Sample Process Steps

Taking a [**business process example**](../terms/flowx-process) of a credit card application, it involves the following steps:


<Steps>

  <Step title="Create Business Process Example">
    [Create a business process example](../terms/flowx-process) of a credit card application.
  </Step>


  <Step title="Initiate Credit Card Request">
    A user initiates a request for a new credit card - _**Start Event**_
  </Step>


  <Step title="Fill in Personal Data">
    The user fills in a form with their personal data - _**User Task**_
  </Step>


  <Step title="Automated Credit Score Check">
    The bank system performs a credit score check automatically using a send event that communicates with the credit score adapter, followed by a receive event to collect the response from the adapter - _**Automatic Task**_
  </Step>


  <Step title="Credit Score Bifurcation">
    The process bifurcates based on the credit score using an _**Exclusive Gateway**_
  </Step>


  <Step title="Save Credit Card Type">
    Each branch entails a service task that saves the appropriate credit card type to the process data - _**Automatic Task**_
  </Step>


  <Step title="Branch Reconciliation">
    The branches reconvene through a _**Closing Gateway**_
  </Step>


  <Step title="View and Confirm Credit Card Details">
    The user views the credit card details and confirms - _**User Task**_
  </Step>


  <Step title="Parallel Branching">
    After user confirmation, the process divides into two parallel branches - _**Parallel Gateway**_. One registers the request in the bank's systems (bank system adapter/integration), and the other sends a confirmation email (notification plugin) to the user
  </Step>


  <Step title="External API Call">
    An additional automatic task follows: a call to an external API to compute the distance between the user's address and the bank locations ([Google Maps Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/overview)) - _**Automatic Task**_
  </Step>


  <Step title="Sort Location Distances">
    A task is utilized to sort the location distances and present the top three to the user - _**Automatic Task**_
  </Step>


  <Step title="Select Card Pickup Point">
    The user selects the card pickup point from the bank location suggestions - _**User Task**_
  </Step>


  <Step title="Receive Confirmation">
    A receive task awaits confirmation from the bank that the user has collected the new card, concluding the process flow - _**End Event**_
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Sample Process Diagram

Here's what the [**BPMN**](../terms/bpmn) diagram illustrates:
