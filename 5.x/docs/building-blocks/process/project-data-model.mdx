## What is a project data model?

<Frame>
![Project Data Model](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/470/pdm.png)
</Frame>

The Project Data Model (PDM) lets you define reusable data types at the project level. These data types propagate to processes within your project, ensuring data consistency across your FlowX.AI applications.

With PDM, you create a centralized data structure that serves as the foundation for all processes within your project. This ensures that core data types like Customer, Product, or Document maintain consistent definitions throughout your application.

## Key concepts

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Data Model Types">
    FlowX.AI supports several types of data models, each serving different purposes:

    | Data Model Type          | Description                                                                                                                                 |
    | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Project Data Model (PDM) | Centralized at the project level. Defines data types that can be reused across processes within the project.                                |
    | Process Data Model       | Specific to an individual process. Contains data types used within that process. Can leverage data types defined in the Project Data Model. |
    | Library Data Model       | Defined within a library. Allows data types to be reused across multiple projects, promoting standardization.                               |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Data Types & Attributes">
    A **data type** defines the structure of a particular set of data. For example, a `Customer` data type might contain attributes like `name`, `email`, and `address`.

    An **attribute** is an individual property of a data type that specifies its data structure.

    Data types and attributes can be categorized based on their usage:

    - **Used/Unused**: A data type or attribute is considered "used" when it's incorporated into the structure of another data type.
    - **Referenced/Unreferenced**: Refers to data types or attributes from the Project Data Model being used within a Process Data Model or a UI Template.

<Accordion title="Benefits demonstrated">
  <Card>
    This example shows how the Project Data Model:

    - **Ensures data consistency**: Core entities like Customer and Policy maintain consistent structures across all processes.
    - **Promotes reusability**: Common data types are defined once and reused in multiple processes.
    - **Simplifies changes**: Updates to data types are propagated automatically to all processes.
    - **Enforces governance**: Sensitive data is marked at the project level for consistent handling.
    - **Allows flexibility**: Process-specific data can extend the PDM while maintaining core data integrity.
  </Card>
</Accordion>

## Best practices

<Check>
**Plan before implementation**: Design your Project Data Model before creating processes to ensure consistency.
</Check>

<Check>
**Use descriptive names**: Choose clear, descriptive names for data types and attributes.
</Check>

<Check>
**Document your model**: Add descriptions to data types and attributes for better understanding.
</Check>

<Check>
**Consider reusability**: Design data types with reusability in mind.
</Check>

<Check>
**Review impact of changes**: Before modifying data types, check their usage across processes.
</Check>

<Check>
**Use libraries for cross-project standards**: For data types needed across multiple projects, define them in libraries.
</Check>

<Check>
**Maintain regularly**: Periodically review and clean up unused data types.
</Check>
