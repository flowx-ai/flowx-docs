The Start integration workflow action allows for data transfer by sending configured inputs to initiate workflows and receiving outputs at the designated result key once the workflow completes. Hereâ€™s an overview of its key functionalities:

### Triggering

When a Start integration workflow action is triggered:

* The input data mapped in Input is sent as start variables to the workflow.
* The workflow runs with these inputs.
* Workflow output data is captured on the the specified result key upon completion.


### Integratiom mapping

The Select Workflows dropdown displays:

* All workflows within the current application version.
* Any workflows referenced in the application (e.g., via the Library).

### Workflow output 

To receive output data from a workflow:

* Add a Receive Message Task node to the BPMN process.
* This node ensures that output data is properly captured and processed based on the designated workflow configuration.
