### Data model reference

You can use data model reference feature to view attribute usage within the data model. You can now easily see where a specific attribute is being used by accessing the "View References" feature. This feature provides a list of process keys associated with each attribute and displays possible references, such as UI Elements.

For UI Elements, the references include the element label, node name, and UI Element key. Additionally, the context of the reference is provided, showing the node name and the UI element type along with its label. Users can conveniently navigate to the context by clicking the provided link to the node's UI page.
