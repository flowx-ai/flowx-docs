Root components play a crucial role in defining the layout and hierarchy of elements within an application. Here's an overview of key root components and their functionalities:


### Container

The Container component is a versatile element used to group and configure the layout for multiple components of any type. It provides a flexible structure for organizing content within a UI.

Learn more about [Container components](./container).

### Custom

Custom components are Angular components developed within the container application and dynamically passed to the SDK at runtime. These components are identified by their unique names and enable developers to extend the functionality of the UI.

Explore [Custom components](./custom) for advanced customization options.

### Card

The Card component functions similarly to a Container component but also offers the capability to function as an accordion, providing additional flexibility in UI design.

Discover more about [Card components](./card).

A card or a container can hold a hierarchical component structure as this example:

<Frame>
