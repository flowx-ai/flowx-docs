These settings can be applied practically in various ways, depending on the context and purpose of the design:

- **Layout Direction and Alignment**: Use these settings to control how content is displayed, ensuring a logical and visually appealing arrangement. For example, a left-to-right layout direction suits languages that read from left to right, while center alignment is ideal for headings or titles.
- **Gap, Sizing, and Spacing**: Manage the distance between elements to create a sense of hierarchy and balance. Adjusting spacing between paragraphs or sections can improve readability, while resizing elements can prioritize certain components within the design.
- **Accessibility Considerations**: Customizing layout direction, alignment, spacing, and sizing can enhance the accessibility and inclusivity of your design. For example, adjusting these settings can make content more readable for users with disabilities or those using assistive technologies.

## Linear layout

The Linear layout arranges child elements in a single line, either horizontally or vertically.

## Grid layout

In addition to linear (flex-based) layouts, you can configure components using a grid layout. This option is particularly useful for designs requiring a more structured and multi-dimensional arrangement of elements.

### Switching layout types

For components that contain child elements (such as Containers, Cards, and Forms), you can easily switch between a linear layout and a Grid layout using a layout picker. The default layout is linear, but you can select Grid to arrange your content in a more structured way.

#### Configuring the grid

Once the Grid layout is selected, you can define the number of columns. Initially, the columns will be distributed equally, meaning all columns will have the same width. Additional customization options include:

- **Number of Columns**: Set the number of columns for the grid. By default, grid will use two columns.
- **Alignment**: Control how child elements are aligned within the grid. Alignment can be adjusted both horizontally and vertically, ensuring that content is positioned exactly where needed.
- **Gap Configuration**: Customize the gap between columns and rows. The default gap is inherited from the parent component's theme settings, ensuring consistency across your design.

#### Grid child settings

When configuring a grid, individual child components can be further customized:

- **Column Span**: Set how many columns a child component should span across.

<Warning>
Col Span should not exceed the number of grid columns.

#### Order property

The Order property is a powerful tool for arranging elements within both linear and grid layouts. By default, all elements are ordered based on their position in the parent component's array. However, this order can be modified:

- **Auto**: Default setting, maintaining the order from the array.
- **First**: Moves the element to the first position by setting its order to `-999`.

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/order_first.gif)
</Frame>

- **Last**: Moves the element to the last position by setting its order to `999`.
- **Manual**: Allows for custom ordering by setting a specific numerical value.

<Tip>
Example: In a Grid with 10 elements, setting one element's order to `5` while the others are set to `auto` (which equals `0`) will place that element last, because `5` is greater than `0`.
</Tip>

#### Alignment in grid layouts

Proper alignment within grid layouts is essential, particularly when working with fixed-width columns or rows. By default, child elements will inherit alignment settings from their parent component, ensuring a consistent look and feel. 

However, you have the flexibility to override these default settings for individual child elements, allowing precise control over horizontal and vertical alignment. This customization is key to achieving the desired visual structure, especially when certain elements need specific positioning within the grid.

### Component details

### Best Practices

To ensure an optimal user experience and consistent visual design, consider these best practices when using grid layouts:

- **Minimize Fixed Widths**: Avoid using fixed widths for child components in a grid. Relying on flexible sizing allows the grid to adapt smoothly across different screen sizes and devices. Only use fixed widths when absolutely necessary (e.g., for icons or buttons with defined sizes).
  
- **Consider Total Width**: If you know the width of the screen is `X`, ensure that the total width of your fixed-width elements doesn't exceed `X`. This prevents layout issues like content overflow or misalignment across different devices.

- **Use Column Span Thoughtfully**: When setting the `columnSpan` for a grid child, ensure that the total spans across all elements do not exceed the number of columns. This ensures a consistent and predictable layout.

- **Avoid Overcrowding**: When adding numerous child components to a grid, be mindful of spacing (gaps) between elements. Proper use of `rowGap` and `columnGap` helps maintain clarity and reduces visual clutter.

- **Leverage Default Inheritance**: Utilize the default alignment inheritance from the parent grid to ensure consistency. Only override alignment on child components when specific visual differences are needed.

- **Use `Auto` Order When Possible**: Stick with the `auto` order setting for most child components, unless a specific element needs to appear first or last. This will help maintain logical reading and visual flow without complex manual ordering.

- **Test Across Platforms**: Given potential differences in behavior between web, iOS, and Android platforms, test your grid layout across these platforms to ensure consistent performance and avoid unexpected behavior like overflow or misalignment.


### FAQs

- **Q: I have a Grid with 10 elements, and I set one element's order to `5`. Why is it not displayed as the fifth element?**
  - **A:** The order property works relative to other elements. If other elements are set to `auto` (which equals `0`), then the element with order `5` will be placed after all the `0` elements, making it appear last.
  
- **Q: What should I be cautious about when working with a Grid layout?**
  - **A:** Be careful with using fixed widths in Grid layouts. Fixed widths can lead to unexpected behavior, especially on different devices. It's better to use flexible sizing options whenever possible to maintain a responsive and predictable design.
