title: UI actions
description: UI Actions link multiple UI elements to specific actions, defining how the interface responds. They determine behaviors such as displaying loaders, dismissing modals, or sending default data back to the process, enhancing the interaction between UI components and underlying logic.
---

UI actions create a connection between multiple UI elements and a specific [**action**](../actions/actions). These actions provide methods for interacting with processes while also defining how the UI should behave in response. For example, they determine whether:

- A loader appears after executing an action.
- A modal is dismissed.
- Default data is sent back to the process.


UI actions link a [**UI component**](./ui-component-types/root-components/custom) or a custom element with the specified action. They enable seamless integration between the user interface and the underlying logic.

## Types of UI actions

- [Process UI Actions](#process-ui-actions)
- [External UI Actions](#external-ui-actions)

### Process UI actions

Process UI Actions (marked `ACTION`) describe how a [**Button**](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/buttons) (generated or custom) interacts with a manual process action. Before defining a UI action, the corresponding [manual action](../actions/actions) must be configured.

For guidance on adding and configuring node actions, refer to:

<Card title="Adding an action to a node" href="../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/adding-an-action-to-a-node" icon ="file">
</Card>

### Example: configuring a manual action (save data)


1. **Add an Action**: Attach an action to a node.  
2. **Select the Action Type**: Choose **Save Data**, for instance.  
3. **Action Type**: Set it to **manual**.

Once the node action is ready, the corresponding UI action can be defined.

Both UI actions and [node actions](../actions/actions) must be configured on the same user task node.

### Example: configuring a UI action


Below are the available configurations for defining a UI Action:

- **Event**: [Learn about Events](#events).  
- **Action Type**: [Explore Action Types](#action-types).  
- **Node Action Name**: Select the desired action from a dropdown (ensure a manual action is added first).  
- **Use a different name for UI action**: Define a unique name for the UI action. This name is essential for triggering the action in a [**Custom Component**](./ui-component-types/root-components/custom).  
- **Add custom keys**: Add custom keys that are not included in the data model
- **Exclude keys**:
- **Add custom body**: Provide a default JSON response. This response is merged with any additional parameters specified during execution.  
- **Add form to submit**: Choose elements to validate (including their children).

- **Hide Subprocess Navigation**: 
- **Show loader**: Displays a loader until a SSE event is received, indicating new data or a new screen.

## UI actions elements

### Events

You can add an event depending on the element that you select. There are two events types available: **CLICK** and **CHANGE**.

<Info>
Not available for UI actions on [Custom components](./ui-component-types/root-components/custom).
</Info>

### Action types

The **action type** dropdown will be pre-filled with the following UI action types:

* DISMISS - used to dismiss a modal after action execution
* ACTION - used to link an action to a UI action
* START_PROCESS_INHERIT - used to inherit data from another process
* UPLOAD - used to create an un upload action
* [EXTERNAL](./ui-actions#external-ui-actions) - used to create an action that will open a link in a new tab

## External UI actions

Used to create an action that will open a link in a new tab.

If we toggle the EXTERNAL type, a few new options are available:

1. **URL** - web URL that will be used for the external action
2. **Open in new tab** - this option will be available to decide if we want to run the action in the current tab or open a new one
