title: UI actions
description: UI Actions link multiple UI elements to specific actions, defining how the interface responds. They determine behaviors such as displaying loaders, dismissing modals, or sending default data back to the process, enhancing the interaction between UI components and underlying logic.
---

UI actions create a connection between multiple UI elements and a specific [**action**](../actions/actions). These actions provide methods for interacting with processes while also defining how the UI should behave in response. For example, they determine whether:

- A loader appears after executing an action.
- A modal is dismissed.
- Default data is sent back to the process.


UI actions link a [**UI component**](./ui-component-types/root-components/custom) or a custom element with the specified action. They enable seamless integration between the user interface and the underlying logic.

## Types of UI actions

- [Process UI Actions](#process-ui-actions)
- [External UI Actions](#external-ui-actions)

### Process UI actions

Process UI Actions (marked `ACTION`) describe how a [**Button**](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/buttons) (generated or custom) interacts with a manual process action. Before defining a UI action, the corresponding [manual action](../actions/actions) must be configured.

For guidance on adding and configuring node actions, refer to:

<Card title="Adding an action to a node" href="../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/adding-an-action-to-a-node">
</Card>

### Example: configuring a manual action (save data)


1. **Add an Action**: Attach an action to a node.  
2. **Select the Action Type**: Choose **Save Data**, for instance.  
3. **Action Type**: Set it to **manual**.  
4. **Keys**: Configure the keys for specific data handling:
   - Keys act as a prefix for the data returned by the UI Action.
   - Example: To send only an email field from a form, configure the key as `application.client.email`.  
   - Keys also enforce backend validation, ensuring only prefixed data is persisted.

Once the node action is ready, the corresponding UI action can be defined.

Both UI actions and [node actions](../actions/actions) must be configured on the same node.

### Example: configuring a UI action

Below are the available configurations for defining a UI action:

* [**Event**](#events)
* [**Type**](#action-types)
* **Node Action Name** - dropdown with available actions for this node. If the dropdown is empty please add a manual action that is required before we create the UI Action
* **Use a different name for UI action**
* **UI action name** - **this becomes** important when the action is used in a [**Custom component**](./ui-component-types/root-components/custom) as it will be used to trigger the action. For UI actions added on a generated button component this name is just descriptive
* **Custom body** - this is the default response in JSON format that will be merged with any extra parameters added explicitly when executing the action, by a web application (from a [custom component](./ui-component-types/root-components/custom))
* **Forms to validate** - select from the dropdown what element will be validated (you can also select the children)
* **Dismiss process** - if the UI Actions is added on a subprocess and this parameter is true, triggering this UI action will dismiss the subprocess view (useful for modals subprocess)
* **Show loader?** - a loader will be displayed if this option is true until a web-socket event will be received (new screen or data)

## UI actions elements

### Events

You can add an event depending on the element that you select. There are two events types available: **CLICK** and **CHANGE**.

<Info>
Not available for UI actions on [Custom components](./ui-component-types/root-components/custom).
</Info>

### Action types

The **action type** dropdown will be pre-filled with the following UI action types:

* DISMISS - used to dismiss a modal after action execution
* ACTION - used to link an action to a UI action
* START_PROCESS_INHERIT - used to inherit data from another process
* UPLOAD - used to create an un upload action
* [EXTERNAL](./ui-actions#external-ui-actions) - used to create an action that will open a link in a new tab

## External UI actions

Used to create an action that will open a link in a new tab.

If we toggle the EXTERNAL type, a few new options are available:

1. **URL** - web URL that will be used for the external action
2. **Open in new tab** - this option will be available to decide if we want to run the action in the current tab or open a new one
