# Resources

This page explains the distinction between **Global Resources** and **Application Resources** within the FlowX.AI Designer platform, highlighting how they are structured, used, and promoted across environments.

---

## Overview

Resources are categorized into **Global Resources** and **Application Resources**. Each type of resource has unique characteristics that determine its usage, dependencies, and how itâ€™s promoted between environments. Understanding these differences is crucial for efficient application development, management, and deployment.

## Global Resources

Global Resources are elements designed to be **reused across multiple applications** or business contexts. These resources are often organized within **libraries**, enabling consistency and efficiency by providing a central repository of shared components.

### Key Characteristics of Global Resources

- **Reusability**: Global Resources are created with the intention of reuse. They include common design elements, themes, fonts, and other assets that can be referenced by multiple applications.
- **Dependency Rules**: Libraries, which store Global Resources, **cannot have dependencies** on other libraries or applications. This ensures that Global Resources remain standalone, maximizing their adaptability across various business cases.
- **Application Independence**: These resources are not application-specific, making them versatile for broad use cases. Applications can reference libraries without requiring modifications to the core resources.
  
### Examples of Global Resources

1. **Design Assets**
   - **Themes**: Standardized themes provide a consistent look and feel across applications.
   - **System Assets**: Common media elements stored in the media library (e.g., images, icons) for theme customization.
   - **Fonts**: Font families that can be reused to maintain branding across different applications.
2. **Plugins**
    - **Languages**:
    - **Notification and Document Templates**: Managed at the global level, although they may be versioned for future releases.
    - **Out of office**:
3. **General settings**
    - **Users**:
    - **Roles**:
    - **Groups**:
    - **Audit Log**:
4. **Libraries**: Organized resource containers including **enumerations**, **substitution tags**, and **CMS components** for multi-application use.

### Promotion of Global Resources

- **Promotion Workflow**: Global Resources within libraries are promoted separately from applications. They are typically **imported into the Designer UI** in target environments as part of their own libraries.
- **Configuration Management**: When libraries are promoted, existing configurations, such as **generic parameters**, are replaced by application-level configurations in the target environment.

---

## Application Resources

Application Resources are resources specific to a particular **business use case**. Unlike Global Resources, these resources are confined to the context of the application they belong to, allowing for tailored configurations and dependencies on one or more libraries.

### Key Characteristics of Application Resources

- **Business Specificity**: Application Resources are tailored to a specific application, addressing unique business requirements.
- **Dependencies on Libraries**: Applications can reference libraries to access Global Resources, allowing for customization and adaptability.
- **Configurability**: Application-specific configurations are defined at the development stage, and values can be updated as needed in upper environments through environment variables or direct parameter overrides.

### Examples of Application Resources

1. **Processes**:
2. **CMS Components**: Custom CMS enumerations, substitution tags, and media items unique to the application.
3. **Task Management**:
    - **Views**:
    - **Hooks**:
    - **Stages**:
    - **Allocation rules**:
4. **Integration Designer**:
    - **Systems**:
    - **Workflows**:
6. **Configuration Parameters**: Application-specific rendering settings like `applicationUuid`, `locale`, `language`, and `process parameters`.
7. **Application Builds**: Builds represent finalized versions of the application, including all associated metadata and linked library versions.
8. **Application Settings**:

### Promotion of Application Resources

- **Promotion Workflow**: Only **builds** (not commits) are eligible for promotion to upper environments. Builds are exported from the development environment and imported into target environments via the Designer UI.
- **Design Asset Handling**: During import, any referenced design assets are created if absent but are not updated, ensuring consistency in upper environments.
- **Configuration Parameters Overrides**: Upper environment values replace development defaults, and these can be managed through environment variables, enabling flexibility without direct development environment access.
