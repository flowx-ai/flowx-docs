In an application we can also reuse resources from a library. 

A library is similar to an application, except that a library can be added as dependency for applications. For example, we have this library containing 2 processes, and we want to use a process form here in another process from another application. We go to our application, to dependencies, and here we add the library as dependency, and select the build. Now, in our process, in the list of subprocesses, we see the resources available in the library as well.
