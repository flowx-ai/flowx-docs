title: Using allocation rules
description: Allocation rules are meant to define when tasks should be auto-assigned to users when they reach a swimlane that has a specific role configured (for example, specific tasks will be assigned for the _front office_ and specific tasks for the _back office_ only).

3. **Allocation** - applied allocation rules
4. **Edited at** - the last time when an allocation was edited
5. **Edited by** - the user who edited/created the allocation rules
