title: Task management
description: Task Management in FlowX.AI is a core functionality that allows users to create, configure, and manage tasks within the platform, providing a structured way to handle work processes. It enables the definition of tasks based on business processes, offers tools for allocating, tracking, and managing tasks across various roles and departments, and supports customization through views, filters, and rules.

Task Management also includes capabilities for user roles, customizable tables, and integration with the application through both low-code and full-code approaches, ensuring flexibility for various use cases.

## Key features

- **Views**: Configurable interfaces to display task-related data based on process definitions.
- **Hooks**:  Upon a token's entry/exit from the selected process, it initiates a specified process, swimlane, or stage based on the configured settings.
- **Stages**: used to monitor the progression of tasks within a process by identifying where it may have stalled. This functionality can be used for teams but also for various business stages: onboarding, verification, and validation processes.
- **Allocation Rules**: Facilitate the equal distribution of tasks among users with permissions in a specific swimlane. 


## Task Management Views

Views offer a flexible way to tailor task data display according to business needs. By configuring views, users can create structured, customized interfaces that help specific roles, departments, or use cases access relevant data effectively.

### All tasks

In the All Tasks section, you can view all tasks generated from any process definition marked as "to be used in task manager" within an application. This provides a centralized view of all relevant tasks, as long as you have the appropriate permissions.

</Frame>

It provides an interactive visualization, with built-in filtering functionalities for refined data display.

<Info>
Dataset Config and Table Config options are not accessible in the All Tasks view.
</Info>

### Creating a view

In the Views section, you can create a new view by selecting a name and choosing a process definition. The process definition is crucial because it determines which keys you can access when configuring the view.

To set up a view, navigate to the Views section in the Task Management interface:

1. Click **Add View**.
2. Enter a **Name** for the view.
3. **Choose a Process Definition**: This will link the view's configuration to a specific process and its associated keys.

<Info>
Once a view is created for a process (e.g., Process X), it cannot be reassigned to another process. This ensures consistent data structuring based on the selected process definition.
</Info>

Upon creating a view, you are automatically redirected to configure its parameters.

</Frame>

The Task Management default view contains four primary columns, with two additional default columns that can be added.

<Tip>
You also have the option to add custom parameters to the table, with no limit on the number of columns.
</Tip>

#### Columns explained

* **Stage**: Indicates where the process halted, providing a clear view of its current state.
* **Assignee**: Displays the individual to whom the task is assigned.
* **Priority**: Reflects the urgency level of the task.
* **Last Updated**: Shows the timestamp of the most recent action taken on the task.
* **Title**: Displays the designated name of the task, which can be customized by using Business Rules.
* **Status**: Represents the current state of a Token, such as 'Started' or 'Finished.'
* **Custom parameters**: User-defined keys within the process settings, which become available only after their configuration is complete.

### Customer parameters and display names

### Display names

You can rename default and custom parameters to make them contextually relevant for various business needs. For example:

* Rename an address field to clarify if it refers to "Residence" or "Issuing Location."

</Frame>


* Use Substitution Tags for dynamic display names.

<Info>
Renaming a parameter’s Display Name will only change how it’s shown in the interface, without altering the actual data model.
</Info>

### Custom parameters


## Task Details

The **Task Details** tab within **Task Manager** provides key process information, including:

* **Priority**: Enables task prioritization.
* **Status**: The current process status.
* **Stage**: Specific stages during process execution.
* **Comments**: User comments.
* **History**: Information such as task creation, creator, and status changes.

## Process status updates

Task Manager displays various statuses based on process state:


| Status         | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Created**    | This status is visible only if there is an issue with the process creation. If the process is error-free in its configuration, you will see the **Started** status instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Started**    | Indicates that the process is in progress and running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Finished**   | The process has reached an end node and completed its execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Failed**     | Displayed when a [CronJob](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/) is enabled in the [FlowX Engine](../../../core-components/flowx-engine). For example, if a CronJob is triggered but not completed on time, tasks move to the `FAILED` status.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Expired**    | <p>Displayed when <code>expiryTime</code> field is defined within the process definition. To set up an <code>expiryTime</code> function, follow these steps</p><ol><li>Go to <strong>FLOWX Designer > Processes > Definitions</strong>.</li><li>Select a process and click the "<strong>⋮</strong>" <strong></strong> button, then choose <strong>Settings.</strong></li><li>Inside the <strong>General</strong> tab, you can edit the <strong>Expiry time</strong> field.</li></ol> |
| **Aborted**    | This status is available for processes that also contain subprocesses. When a subprocess is running (and the [token is moved backward](../../../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/moving-a-token-backwards-in-a-process) to redo a series of previous actions) - the subprocess will be aborted.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Dismissed**  | Available for processes that contain subprocesses. It is displayed when a user stops a subprocess.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **On hold**    | Freezes the process, blocking further actions. A superuser can trigger this status for clarification or unfreeze.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Terminated** | A request is sent via Kafka to terminate a process instance, ending all active tokens in the current process or subprocesses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Task Assignment and Reassignment 

Consider this scenario: you're the HR manager overseeing the onboarding process for new employees. In order to streamline this operation, you've opted to leverage a task manager plugin. This process consists of two key phases: the Initiation Stage and the Account Setup Stage, each requiring a designated team member.

The Initiation Stage has successfully concluded, marking the transition to the Account Setup Stage. At this juncture, it's essential to reassign the task, originally assigned to John Doe, to Jane Doe, a valuable member of the backoffice team.

## Managing On-Hold Projects

As a project manager overseeing various ongoing projects, you may need to temporarily pause one due to unforeseen circumstances. To manage this, you use the "On Hold" status.

## Adding Comments 

When handling on-hold projects, document the reasons, inform the team, and plan for resumption. This pause helps address issues and ensures a smoother project flow upon resuming. Never forget to add comments:

![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/tsk_hold_comment.gif)

## Viewing the Application

Property used to point to the application url where the flowx process is loaded.

### Process settings level

In the Process Definitions settings, navigate to the **Task Management** tab and locate the **Application URL** field. Here, paste the application URL where the process is loaded, following this format:

```
{baseURL}/processes/instance
```

Example:

![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/tsk_view_app.png)


<Tip>
You can also use a predefined generic parameter as the URL: `${genericParameter}`.

![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/tsk_generic_param.png)

![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/tsk_generic_param1.png)

</Tip>

### Process data level

If task.baseUrl is specified in the process parameters, it will be sent to the Task Manager to update the tasks accordingly.
```java
output.put("task", {"baseUrl": "https://your_base_url"});
```



<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/tsk_manager_base_url.png)
</Frame>

<Warning>
The `baseURL` set in the process data (business rules) will override the `baseURL` set in the process definition settings.
</Warning>

## Bulk updates

Send bulk update requests via Kafka (using Process Engine) to perform multiple operations at once. Use the Kafka topic:

* `KAFKA_TOPIC_PROCESS_OPERATIONS_BULK_IN` (defined in Process Engine) to send operations from "KAFKA_TOPIC_PROCESS_OPERATIONS_IN" as an array, allowing multiple operations at once. More details [**here**](../../../../../setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup#topics-related-to-the-task-management-plugin).

Example of a bulk request:

```json
{

  "operations": [
    {
      "operationType": "HOLD",
      "taskId": "some task id",
      "processInstanceUuid": "d3aabfd8-d041-4c62-892f-22d17923b223", // the id of the process instance
      "swimlaneName": "Default", //name of the swimlane
      "owner": null,
      "author": "john.doe@flowx.ai",
      "requestID": "1234567891"
    },
    {
      "operationType": "HOLD",
      "taskId": "some task id",
      "processInstanceUuid": "d3aabfd8-d041-4c62-892f-22d17923b223",
      "swimlaneName": "Default", //name of the swimlane
      "owner": null,
      "author": "jonh.doe@flowx.ai",
      "requestID": "1234567890"
    }
  ]
}      
```
