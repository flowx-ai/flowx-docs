title: Swimlanes - Role-Based Process Access Control
description: Swimlanes provide role-based access control (RBAC) for process nodes, allowing you to restrict and manage user permissions across different process stages. Learn how to use swimlanes to group process nodes by user roles and process participants.

# Understanding Swimlanes and Role-Based Access

Swimlanes are a crucial feature for implementing role-based access control within processes. They enable you to group process nodes and restrict access based on user roles, ensuring that only authorized participants can interact with specific parts of a process.

## Key Features of Swimlanes

* **Role-Based Access Control**: Configure swimlanes to grant access only to users with specific roles defined in your identity provider platform
* **Process Node Grouping**: Organize related process [**nodes**](../../building-blocks/node/) into logical groups based on user responsibilities
* **Dynamic Access Management**: Control who can initiate, view, and perform actions on process instances

## Managing Swimlane Permissions

The type of node placed within a swimlane determines what actions authorized users can perform. Users must have the corresponding swimlane roles to:
- Initiate process instances
- View process instances
- Perform actions on process instances

For detailed information about process management permissions, see [Scopes and roles for managing processes](../../../setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/configuring-access-roles-for-processes).

## Working with Swimlanes

### Default Swimlane
When you create a new process definition, the system automatically adds a default swimlane to get you started.

### Token Movement Between Swimlanes
As a process token moves between nodes in different swimlanes:
* Users without access to the new swimlane will see the process in read-only mode
* Access is automatically restored when the token returns to a swimlane where the user has permissions
* Users receive notifications about changes in their ability to interact with the process
