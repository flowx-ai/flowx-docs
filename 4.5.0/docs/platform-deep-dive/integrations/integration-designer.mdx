title: Integration Designer
description: The Integration Designer simplifies the integration of FlowX with external systems using REST APIs. It offers a user-friendly graphical interface with intuitive drag-and-drop functionality for defining data models, orchestrating workflows, and configuring system endpoints.
---

<Card title ="Did you know?" icon="info">
Unlike [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), which focuses on API testing, the Integration Designer automates workflows between systems. With drag-and-drop ease, it handles REST API connections, real-time processes, and error management, making integrations scalable and easy to mantain.

## Overview

Integration Designer is a powerful tool developed to facilitate the seamless integration of the FlowX platform with external systems, applications, and data sources.

## Managing integration endpoints

With **Systems** feature you can create, update, and organize endpoints used in API integrations. These endpoints are integral to building workflows within the Integration Designer, offering flexibility and ease of use for managing connections between systems. Endpoints can be configured, tested, and reused across multiple workflows, streamlining the integration process.

### Creating a new system definition


Go to the **Systems** section in FlowX Designer at **Projects** -> **Your application** -> **Integrations** -> **Systems**.
        
1. Add a **New System**, set the system’s unique code, name, and description:
    * **Code**: A unique identifier for the external system.
    * **Name**: The system's name.
    * **Description**: A description of the system and its purpose.

2. Configure the system’s **Base URL**.

<Tip>
Base URL: Supports environment-based URL configuration (e.g., https://api.example.com/v0/{environment}).
</Tip>

3. Set up authorization (Service Token, Bearer Token, or No Auth).

### Defining REST integration endpoints

In this section you can define REST API endpoints that can be reused across different workflows.

1. Under the **Endpoints** section, add the necessary endpoints for system integration.

</Frame>

2. Configure an endpoint by filling in the following properties:
    - **Method**: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.
    - **Path**: Path for the endpoint.
    - **Parameters**: Path, query, and header parameters.
    - **Response**: Expected response codes and formats.
    - **Body**: JSON payload for requests.

</Frame>

### Defining variables

The Variables Tab allows you to store system-specific variables that can be referenced throughout workflows using the format `${variableName}`.

These declared variables can be utilized not only in workflows but also in other sections, such as the Endpoint or Authorization tabs.

<Tip> 
For example:
- You can declare a variable to store your authentication token and reference it in the **Authorization** tab. 
- Use variables in the **Base URL** to switch between different environments, such as UAT or production.

</Tip>

### Endpoint parameter types

When configuring endpoints, several parameter types help define how the endpoint interacts with external systems. These parameters ensure that requests are properly formatted and data is correctly passed.

#### Path parameters

Elements embedded directly within the URL path of an API request that acts as a placeholder for specific value.

- Used to specify variable parts of the endpoint URL (e.g., `/users/{userId}`).
- Defined with `${parameter}` format.
- Mandatory in the request URL.

<Tip>
Path parameters must always be included, while query and header parameters are optional but can be set as required based on the endpoint’s design.
</Tip>

#### Query parameters

Parameters added to the end of a URL to provide extra information to a web server when making requests.

- Optional key-value pairs added to the URL (e.g., `?search=value`).
- Useful for filtering or pagination.

#### Header parameters

Used to give information about the request and basically to give instructions to the API of how to handle the request.

- Custom headers sent with the request (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer token`).
- Define metadata or authorization details.

#### Body parameters

The data sent to the server when an API request is made.

- These are the data fields included in the body of a request, usually in JSON format.
- Body parameters are used in POST, PUT, and PATCH requests to send data to the external system (e.g., creating or updating a resource).

</Frame>

#### Response body parameters

The data sent back from the server after an API request is made.

- These parameters are part of the response returned by the external system after a request is processed. They contain the data that the system sends back.
- Typically returned in GET, POST, PUT, and PATCH requests. Response body parameters provide details about the result of the request (e.g., confirmation of resource creation, or data retrieval)

### Authorization

Authorization defines how external systems verify the identity of the requests made by the Integration Designer. There are multiple types of authorization that can be configured depending on the system's requirements.


#### Service account

   - Requires two fields:
     - **Realm**: The domain or scope under which the service account operates.
     - **Client ID**: The unique identifier for the client within the realm.

2. **Basic Authentication**:
   - Requires the following credentials:
     - **Username**: The account's username.
     - **Password**: The account's password.
   - Suitable for systems that rely on simple username/password combinations for access.

3. **Bearer Token (Future Support)**:
   - Requires an **Access Token** to be included in the request headers.
   - Commonly used for OAuth 2.0 implementations.

#### **Configuring Authorization:**

- Select the required **Authorization Type** from a predefined list.
- Enter the relevant details based on the selected type (e.g., Realm and Client ID for Service Accounts).
- These details will be automatically included in the request headers when the integration is executed.

---

**Note:** Additional authentication methods like OAuth 2.0 and API key support may be introduced in future updates.



### Workflow Definition

* Workflow Nodes: Users can configure the workflow with various nodes, such as Send Message Tasks, Start/End nodes, Fork nodes, REST endpoints, and Data Mappings.
* Trigger Workflow: Workflows can be triggered through various means, such as Kafka events or HTTP triggers.
* Error Handling: In-built error handling within the workflow allows for graceful recovery and logging of issues.
