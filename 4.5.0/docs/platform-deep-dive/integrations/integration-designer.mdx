title: Integration Designer
description: The Integration Designer simplifies the integration of FlowX with external systems using REST APIs. It offers a user-friendly graphical interface with intuitive drag-and-drop functionality for defining data models, orchestrating workflows, and configuring system endpoints.
---

<Card title ="Did you know?" icon="info">
Unlike [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), which focuses on API testing, the Integration Designer automates workflows between systems. With drag-and-drop ease, it handles REST API connections, real-time processes, and error management, making integrations scalable and easy to mantain.

## Managing integration endpoints


### Systems

A system is a collection of resources—endpoints, authentication, and variables—used to define and run integration workflows.

</Frame>


### Creating a new system definition

With **Systems** feature you can create, update, and organize endpoints used in API integrations. These endpoints are integral to building workflows within the Integration Designer, offering flexibility and ease of use for managing connections between systems. Endpoints can be configured, tested, and reused across multiple workflows, streamlining the integration process.

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/systems.png)
</Frame>


Go to the **Systems** section in FlowX Designer at **Projects** -> **Your application** -> **Integrations** -> **Systems**.
        
1. Add a **New System**, set the system’s unique code, name, and description:
    * **Code**: A unique identifier for the external system.
    * **Name**: The system's name.
    * **Description**: A description of the system and its purpose.
 
2. Configure the system’s **Base URL**.

<Tip>
To dynamically adjust the base URL based on the upper environment (e.g., dev, QA, stage), you can use environment variables and configuration parameters. For example: https://api.${environment}.example.com/v1.
</Tip>

3. Set up authorization (Service Token, Bearer Token, or No Auth).

### Defining REST integration endpoints

In this section you can define REST API endpoints that can be reused across different workflows.

1. Under the **Endpoints** section, add the necessary endpoints for system integration.

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/add_new_endpoint.png)
</Frame>

2. Configure an endpoint by filling in the following properties:
    - **Method**: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.
    - **Path**: Path for the endpoint.
    - **Parameters**: Path, query, and header parameters.
    - **Response**: Expected response codes and formats.
    - **Body**: JSON payload for requests.

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/configure_endpoint.png)
</Frame>

### Defining variables

The Variables Tab allows you to store system-specific variables that can be referenced throughout workflows using the format `${variableName}`.

These declared variables can be utilized not only in workflows but also in other sections, such as the Endpoint or Authorization tabs.

<Tip> 
For example:
- You can declare a variable to store your authentication token and reference it in the **Authorization** tab. 
- Use variables in the **Base URL** to switch between different environments, such as UAT or production.

</Tip>

### Endpoint parameter types

When configuring endpoints, several parameter types help define how the endpoint interacts with external systems. These parameters ensure that requests are properly formatted and data is correctly passed.

#### Path parameters

Elements embedded directly within the URL path of an API request that acts as a placeholder for specific value.

- Used to specify variable parts of the endpoint URL (e.g., `/users/{userId}`).
- Defined with `${parameter}` format.
- Mandatory in the request URL.


<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/path_parameters.png)
</Frame>

<Tip>
Path parameters must always be included, while query and header parameters are optional but can be set as required based on the endpoint’s design.
</Tip>

#### Query parameters

Parameters added to the end of a URL to provide extra information to a web server when making requests.

- Parameters added to the end of a URL to provide extra information to a web server when making requests. (e.g., `?search=value`).
- Useful for filtering or pagination.

</Frame>

<Warning>
Query parameters should only be defined in the system table and not included in the path. 
</Warning>

#### Header parameters

Used to give information about the request and basically to give instructions to the API of how to handle the request

- Header parameters (HTTP headers) provide extra details about the request or its message body. 
- They are not part of the URL. Default values can be set for testing and overridden in the workflow.
- Custom headers sent with the request (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer token`).
- Define metadata or authorization details.

</Frame>


#### Body parameters

The data sent to the server when an API request is made.

- These are the data fields included in the body of a request, usually in JSON format.
- Body parameters are used in POST, PUT, and PATCH requests to send data to the external system (e.g., creating or updating a resource).

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/body_param.png)
</Frame>

#### Response body parameters

The data sent back from the server after an API request is made.

- These parameters are part of the response returned by the external system after a request is processed. They contain the data that the system sends back.
- Typically returned in GET, POST, PUT, and PATCH requests. Response body parameters provide details about the result of the request (e.g., confirmation of resource creation, or data retrieval)

<Frame>

</Frame>


### Configuring authorization

- Select the required **Authorization Type** from a predefined list.
- Enter the relevant details based on the selected type (e.g., Realm and Client ID for Service Accounts).
- These details will be automatically included in the request headers when the integration is executed.

### Authorization types

The Integration Designer supports several authorization methods, allowing you to configure the security settings for API calls. Depending on the external system's requirements, you can choose one of the following authorization formats:

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/auth_type.png)
</Frame>

#### Service account

Requires two fields:
    
- **Realm**: The domain or scope under which the service account operates.
- **Client ID**: The unique identifier for the client within the realm.
- **Client secret**:
- **Identity Provider Url**:

#### Basic authentication

- Requires the following credentials:
    - **Username**: The account's username.
    - **Password**: The account's password.
        - Suitable for systems that rely on simple username/password combinations for access.

#### Bearer

- Requires an **Access Token** to be included in the request headers.
- Commonly used for OAuth 2.0 implementations.

## Workflow Definition

* Workflow Nodes: Users can configure the workflow with various nodes, such as Send Message Tasks, Start/End nodes, Fork nodes, REST endpoints, and Data Mappings.
* Trigger Workflow: Workflows can be triggered through various means, such as Kafka events or HTTP triggers.
* Error Handling: In-built error handling within the workflow allows for graceful recovery and logging of issues.
