title: Generate OTP
description: There are some cases when you will need to generate an OTP (One Time Password) from a business flow, for example when validating an email account.
---

The notifications plugin handles both the actual OTP code generation and sending the code to the user using a defined [notification template](../managing-notification-templates).

## Define needed Kafka topics

<Info>
**DEVELOPER**: Kafka topic names can be set/found by using the following environment variables in your Notifications plugin deployment:

* `KAFKA_TOPIC_OTP_GENERATE_IN`
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_OTP_GENERATE_OUT` - after the OTP is generated and sent to the user, this is the topic used to send the response back to the Engine.
</Info>

<Info>
The Engine is listening for messages on topics with names of a certain pattern, make sure to use an outgoing topic name that matches the pattern configured in the Engine.
</Info>

## Request to generate an OTP

Values expected in the request body:

* **templateName**: the name of the notification template that is used (created using the [WYSIWYG](../../../wysiwyg) editor)
* **channe**l: notification channel (SMS / MAIL)
* **recipient**: notification receiver: email / phone number
* **notification template content parameters (for example, clientId)**: parameters that should be replaced in the [notification template](../managing-notification-templates)

## Example: generate an OTP from a business flow

It is important to identify what is the business identifier that you are going to use to validate that OTP, it can be, for example, a user identification number.

1. Configure the templates that you want to use (for example, an SMS template).
2. Make sure the Kafka communication through (`KAFKA_TOPIC_OTP_GENERATE_IN` topic - send the otp request) and the topic used to receive the response (`KAFKA_TOPIC_OTP_GENERATE_OUT`) is defined properly.

<Tip>
You can check the defined topics by going to **FlowX Designer > Platform Status > notification-plugin-mngt > kafkaTopicsHealthCheckIndicator > details > configuration > topic > otp**.
</Tip>

3. Use the FlowX Designer to add a new **Kafka send event** to the correct node in the process definition.
4. Add the proper configuration to the action, the Kafka topic, and configure the body message.

5. Add a node to the process definition (for the Kafka receive event).
6. Configure on what key you want to receive the response on the process instance params.
