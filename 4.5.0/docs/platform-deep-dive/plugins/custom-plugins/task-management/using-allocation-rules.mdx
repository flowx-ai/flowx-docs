title: Using allocation rules
description: Allocation rules are meant to define when tasks should be auto-assigned to users when they reach a swimlane that has a specific role configured (for example, specific tasks will be assigned for the _front office_ and specific tasks for the _back office_ only).

<Info>
Tasks will always be allocated depending on the users load (number of tasks) from current/other processes. If there are two or more users with the same number of assigned tasks, the task will be randomly assigned to one of them.
