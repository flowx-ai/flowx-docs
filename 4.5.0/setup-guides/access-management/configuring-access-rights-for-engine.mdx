Two different access authorizations are provided, each with specified access scopes:

1. **Manage-processes** - for configuring access for running test processes

Available scopes:

* **edit** - users are able to start processes for testing and to test action rules

2. **Manage-instances** - for configuring access for manipulating process instances

Available scopes:

* **read** - users can view the list of process instances
* **admin** - users are able to retry an action on a process instance token

The Engine service is preconfigured with the following default users roles for each of the access scopes mentioned above:

* **manage-processes**
  * edit:
    * ROLE_ADMIN_MANAGE_PROCESS_EDIT
    * ROLE_ADMIN_MANAGE_PROCESS_ADMIN
  
  * admin:
    * ROLE_ADMIN_MANAGE_PROCESS_ADMIN

* **manage-instances**
  * read:
    * ROLE_ENGINE_MANAGE_INSTANCE_READ
    * ROLE_ENGINE_MANAGE_INSTANCE_ADMIN
  
  * admin:
    * ROLE_ENGINE_MANAGE_INSTANCE_ADMIN

<Check>
These roles need to be defined in the chosen identity provider solution.
</Check>

In case other custom roles are needed, you can configure them using environment variables. More than one role can be set for each access scope.

To configure access for each of the roles above, adapt the following input:

`SECURITY_ACCESSAUTHORIZATIONS_AUTHORIZATIONNAME_SCOPES_SCOPENAME_ROLESALLOWED:NEEDED_ROLE_NAMES`

Possible values for AUTHORIZATIONNAME: MANAGEPROCESSES, MANAGEINSTANCES.

Possible values for SCOPENAME: read, edit, admin.

For example, if you need to configure role access for read, insert this:

```
SECURITY_ACCESSAUTHORIZATIONS_MANAGEINSTANCES_SCOPES_READ_ROLESALLOWED: ROLE_NAME_TEST
```
