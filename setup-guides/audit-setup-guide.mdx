## Infrastructure prerequisites

The Audit service requires the following components to be set up before it can be started:

* **Docker engine** - version 17.06 or higher
* **Kafka** - version 2.8 or higher
* **Elasticsearch** - version 7.11.0 or higher

## Dependencies

The Audit service is built as a Docker image and runs on top of Kafka and Elasticsearch. Therefore, these services must be set up and running before starting the Audit service.

* [**Kafka configuration**](./platform-setup-guides-docs.md#kafka) 
* [**Authorization & access roles**](./platform-setup-guides-docs.md#authorization--access-roles)
* [**Elastic search**](#elastic-search)
* [**Logging**](./platform-setup-guides-docs.md#logging)

## Configuration

### Configuring Kafka

To configure the Kafka server for the Audit service, set the following environment variables:

* `SPRING_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` - address of the Kafka server, it should be in the format "host:port"

* `SPRING_KAFKA_CONSUMER_GROUP_ID` - the consumer group ID to be used for the audit logs

* `KAFKA_CONSUMER_THREADS` - the number of Kafka consumer threads to be used for processing audit logs

* `KAFKA_TOPIC_AUDIT_IN` - the topic key for receiving audit logs

### Configuring Elasticsearch

To configure Elasticsearch, set the following environment variables:

* `SPRING_ELASTICSEARCH_REST_URIS` - the URL(s) of one or more Elasticsearch nodes to connect to

* `SPRING_ELASTICSEARCH_REST_DISABLESSL` - a boolean value that determines whether SSL should be disabled for Elasticsearch connections
   
* `SPRING_ELASTICSEARCH_REST_USERNAME` - the username to use for basic authentication when connecting to Elasticsearch

* `SPRING_ELASTICSEARCH_REST_PASSWORD` - the password to use for basic authentication when connecting to Elasticsearch

* `SPRING_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX_SETTINGS_DATASTREAM` (used if ES is used across all dev environments) - the index settings for the datastreams that will be created in Elasticsearch 



### Configuring logging

To control the log levels, set the following environment variables:

* `LOGGING_LEVEL_ROOT` - the log level for the root spring boot microservice logs

* `LOGGING_LEVEL_APP` - the log level for app-level logs

Make sure to overwrite the placeholders (where needed) with the appropriate values before starting the service.
