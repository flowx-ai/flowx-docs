title: FlowX.AI Engine
description: The engine is the core of the platform, it is the service that runs instances of the process definitions, generates UI, communicates with the frontend and also with custom integrations and plugins. It keeps track of all currently running process instances and makes sure the process flows run correctly.

## Orchestration

Creating and interacting with process instances is pretty straightforward, as most of the interaction happens automatically and is handled by the engine.

The only points that need used interaction are starting the process and executing user tasks on it (for example when a user fills in a form on the screen and saves the results).
