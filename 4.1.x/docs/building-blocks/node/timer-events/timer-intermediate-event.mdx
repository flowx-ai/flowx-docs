- ISO 8601 format (example: `2019-10-01T12:00:00Z` - UTC time, `2019-10-02T08:09:40+02:00`- UTC plus two hours zone offset)

#### Duration

Event triggered after x duration after the token reached the timer node (or parent node) (example: `PT6S`).

* Definition:
    * ISO
    * Cron
    * Process param

## General Rules

* A Timer Intermediate Event is triggered based on its duration or date definition.
* When the token enters a Timer Intermediate Event, a scheduler is set, and it waits for the timer event to be triggered.
* After the timer is triggered, the process instance continues.
