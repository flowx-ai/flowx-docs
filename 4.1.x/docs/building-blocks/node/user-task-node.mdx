## Configuring a user task node

<Frame>

![User Task Node](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/user_task_node.png#center)

</Frame>

User task nodes allow you to define and configure UI templates and possible [actions](../actions/actions) for a certain template config node (ex: [button components](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/buttons)).

#### General Config

* **Node name** - the name of the node
* **Can go back** - setting this to true will allow users to return to this step after completing it. When encountering a step with `canGoBack` false, all steps found behind it will become unavailable.

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/node_config_new.png)
</Frame>

<Info>
When encountering a step with `canGoBack` switched to false, all steps found behind it will become unavailable.
</Info>

* [**Swimlane**](../../platform-deep-dive/user-roles-management/swimlanes) - choose a swimlane (if there are multiple swimlanes on the process) to make sure only certain user roles have access to certain process nodes- if there are no multiple swimlanes, the value is **Default**
* [**Stage** ](../../platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/task-management/using-stages)- assign a stage to the node


#### Data stream topics

* **Topic Name** - the topic name where the process engine listens for the response (this should be added to the platform and match the topic naming rule for the engine to listen to it) - available for UPDATES topics (Kafka receive events)

<Check>
A naming pattern must be defined on the [process engine configuration](../../../setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup#configuring-kafka) to use the defined topics. It is important to know that all the events that start with a configured pattern will be consumed by the Engine. For example, `KAFKA_TOPIC_PATTERN` is the topic name pattern where the Engine listens for incoming Kafka events.
</Check>

* **Key Name** - will hold the result received from the external system, if the key already exists in the process values, it will be overwritten

#### Task Management

* **Update task management** - force [Task Management](../../platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/task-management/) plugin to update information about this process after this node

## Configuring the UI

The **FlowX Designer** includes an intuitive [UI Designer](../ui-designer/ui-designer) (drag-and-drop editor) for creating diverse UI templates. You can use various elements from basic [buttons](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/buttons), indicators, and [forms](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/), but also predefined [collections](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/collection/collection) or [prototypes](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/collection/collection_prototype).

### Accessing the UI Designer

To access the **UI Designer**, follow the next steps:

1. Open **FLOWX Designer** and from the **Processes** tab select **Definitions**.
2. Select a **process** from the process definitions list.
3. Click the **Edit** **process** button.
4. Select a **user task** **node** from the Pro dcess Designer then click the **brush** icon to open the **UI Designer**.

</Card>

### Predefined components

UI can be defined using the available components provided by FLOWX, using the UI Designer available at node level.

Predefined components can be split in 3 categories:


<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title ="Root components">

These elements are used to group different types of components, each having a different purpose:

* [**Card**](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/root-components/card) - used to group and configure the layout for multiple **form elements.**
* [**Container**](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/root-components/container) - used to group and configure the layout for multiple **components** of any type.
* [**Custom**](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/root-components/custom) - these are Angular components developed in the container application and passed to the SDK at runtime, identified here by the component name

More details in the following section:

<Card title ="Root components" href="../ui-designer/ui-component-types/root-components/root-components">
</Card>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title ="UI components">

The root component can hold a hierarchical component structure.

Available children for **Card** and **Container** are:

* **Container** - used to group and align its children
* **Form** - used to group and align form field elements (**inputs**, **radios**, **checkboxes**, etc)
* **Image** - allows you to configure an image in the document
* **Text** - a simple text can be configured via this component, basic configuration is available
* **Hint** - multiple types of hints can be configured via this component
* **Link** - used to configure a hyperlink that opens in a new tab
* **Button** - Multiple options are available for configuration, the most important part being the possibility to add actions
* **File Upload** - A specific type of button that allows you to select a file


More details in the following section:

<Card title="Component types" href="../ui-designer/ui-designer#user-task-node-ui-components">
</Card>
</Accordion>


<Accordion title ="Form elements">

This type of elements are used to allow the user to input data, and can be added only in a **Form** Component. They have have multiple properties that can be managed.

1. [**Input**](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/input-form-field) - FLOWX form element that allows you to generate an input form filed
2. [**Select**](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/select-form-field) - to add a dropdown
3. [**Checkbox**](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/checkbox-form-field) - the user can select zero or more input from a set of options
4. [**Radio**](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/radio-form-field) - the user is required to select one and only one input from a set of options
5. [**Datepicker**](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/datepicker-form-field) - to select a date from a calendar picker
6. [**Switch**](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/switch-form-field) - allows the user to toggle an option on or off

More details in the following section:

<Card title ="Form elements" href="../ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements">
</Card>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Custom components

These are components developed in the web application and referenced here by component identifier. This will dictate where the component is displayed in the component hierarchy and what actions are available for the component.

To add a custom component in the template config tree, we need to know its unique identifier and the data it should receive from the process model.

More details in the following section:

## Displaying a UI Element in FlowX Designer

When a process instance is started the web application will receive all the UI elements that can be displayed in that process.

1. Starting a Process:

- The process is initiated by sending a request to the renderer `POST/ {BASE_URL}/onboarding/api/process/{name}/start`
- This tells the server to start the specific process definition, in this case, named "DemoProcess".

```json
...
{
  "processDefinitionName" : "DemoProcess",
  "tokens" : [ {
    "id" : 1961367,
    "startNodeId" : null,
    "embedNodeId" : null,
    "mainSwimlaneId" : null,
    "currentProcessVersionId" : 861684,
    "currentContext" : "main",
    "initiatorType" : null,
    "initiatorId" : null,
    "currentNodeId" : 921777,
    "currentNodeName" : null,
    "state" : "ACTIVE",
    "statusCurrentNode" : "ARRIVED",
    "dateUpdated" : "2024-09-23T09:29:06.668355Z",
    "uuid" : "60ecb3a1-0073-4d98-86b8-263bdaa95a8b"
  } ],
  "state" : "STARTED"
  ...
}
```

2. Displaying UI Elements:

- As the process progresses, it reaches different nodes, in our example, "User Tasks" (nodes that require human interaction).
- When a User Task is reached, a server message is sent to the application, instructing it to display the UI element associated with that users task. This UI element is essentially the part of the interface that the user will interact with at this point in the process.
- Inside the `templateConfig` you can find all the UI elements configured on the node. In the following example you can see the details of a `CARD` UI element.

```json
...
 "templateConfig" : [ {
      "id" : 781824,
      "flowxUuid" : "771f7a69-2858-4ef4-8f58-a052c0cfe724",
      "componentIdentifier" : "CARD",
      "type" : "FLOWX",
      "order" : 1,
      "canGoBack" : true,
      "displayOptions" : {
        "flowxProps" : {
          "title" : "Company representative",
          "hasAccordion" : false
        },
        "style" : {
          "widthType" : "fixed",
          "layoutType" : "grid",
          "flexLayout" : {
            "fxLayout" : "row wrap",
            "fxLayoutAlign" : "start start",
            "fxLayoutGap" : 10
          },
          "gridLayout" : {
            "columns" : 3,
            "position" : "start start",
            "columnGap" : 8,
            "rowGap" : 8
          },
          "gridChild" : {
            "colSpan" : 1,
            "rowSpan" : 1,
            "order" : 0
          },
          "heightType" : "auto",
          "width" : 950
        },
        "className" : null,
        "platform" : "web"
      }
      } ]
...
```


3. Matching UI Elements to User Tasks:

- When the application receives an update ProgressUpdateDto will trigger the SDK to search for the UI element having the same `nodeId` with the one in the SSE event.

Start process response:

```json
...
      "navigationAreaId" : 86501151,
      "nodeDefinitionId" : 921779,
      "context" : "main"
...
```

SSE event:

```json
"{\"progressUpdateDTO\":{\"processInstanceUuid\":\"271f00b9-4344-4a82-8479-378be92a5377\",\"tokenUuid\":\"7fd79711-ec92-425e-8b5d-8bb6c6362095\",\"currentNodeId\":921779,\"currentContext\":\"main\"}}"
```


4. Fetching Data and Actions:

- To display the UI element correctly, the application may need additional data or perform certain actions. 
- It retrieves this data via a request to the server. This step ensures that the displayed UI element has all the information and functionality it needs to work properly, like updating the displayed information or enabling specific actions for the user.

In simple terms, the process involves starting a sequence, notifying the application when to show specific user interface parts, and ensuring these parts have the necessary data to function correctly.
