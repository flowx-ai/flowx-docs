## Android SDK migration guide

### Changes regarding the implementation of Custom Components

The support for classical **[Android View](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View)** system has been dropped.<br/>
A Custom Component can now be implemented only by using the **[Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose)** UI system.

This means that the `CustomViewComponent` is now ignored in the internals of the SDK and has been marked as `@Deprecated`, in order to be completely removed in the next release.

<Info>
   There is no immediate need to update any of the existing components.
